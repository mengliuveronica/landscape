1,towards a culture of open scholarship: the role of pedagogical communities comment,open scholarship; open educational resources; open science; open; research; pedagogy; reproducibility; research integrity,"the uk house of commons science and technology committee has called for evidence on the roles that different stakeholders play in reproducibility and research integrity. of central priority are proposals for improving research integrity and quality, as well as guidance and support for researchers. in response to this, we argue that there is one important component of research integrity that is often absent from discussion: the pedagogical consequences of how we teach, mentor, and supervise students through open scholarship. we justify the need to integrate open scholarship principles into research training within higher education and argue that pedagogical communities play a key role in fostering an inclusive culture of open scholarship. we illustrate these benefits by presenting the framework for open and reproducible research training (forrt), an international grassroots community whose goal is to provide support, resources, visibility, and advocacy for the adoption of principled, open teaching and mentoring practices, whilst generating conversations about the ethics and social impact of higher-education pedagogy. representing a diverse group of early-career researchers and students across specialisms, we advocate for greater recognition of and support for pedagogical communities, and encourage all research stakeholders to engage with these communities to enable long-term, sustainable change.",open science,10.1186/s13104-022-05944-1
2,librarians' perceptions of the challenges for researchers in rwanda and the potential of open scholarship,open scholarship; open science; open research; open access; epistemic; injustice; rwanda,"open scholarship is a major reform movement within research. this paper seeks to understand how open scholarship might address the challenges faced by research in africa, through a study based on a participatory collaborative workshop to create a partnership with librarians in rwanda. the literature review identifies three broad perspectives on the apparent under-performance of rwandan research: one locating the issue in the unequal scholarly communications system, a second pointing to a country deficit and a third blaming cognitive injustices. the rwandan librarians see researchers as challenged through the pressures on them to publish, the costs of research, poor infrastructure, lack of skills and limited access to literature. collectively these challenges constitute a critical barrier to research. these limits fit largely the country deficit perspective. open scholarship as conceived in the global north is only a small part of the answer to the challenges faced by rwandan scholars. to promote equity, notions of open scholarship need to take into account the conditions under which research is conducted in less privileged contexts such as rwanda.",higher-education; global south; open science; africa; knowledge; power,10.1515/libri-2020-0036

(3) the huge investments in developing ds skills and capacities by some global companies and strong countries is leading to imbalances and fears by different stakeholders hampering the acceptance of open science (os). (4) finally, osd will depend on the availability of a global infrastructure fostering an integrated and interoperable data domain-''one data-domain'' as george strawn calls it-which is still not visible due to differences about the technological key pillars. os therefore is a need for ds, but it will take much more time to implement it than we may have expected.","",10.1162/dint\_a\_00082

69,disclosure or secrecy? the dynamics of open science,open science; pasteur's quadrant; overlapping generations,"open science is a dynamic system of knowledge production that depends on the disclosure of knowledge by researchers as an input into knowledge production by future researchers. to analyze the conditions supporting open science, we develop an overlapping generations model that focuses on the trade-off between disclosure and secrecy. while secrecy yields private returns that are independent of the actions of future generations, the benefits of disclosure depend in part on the use of disclosed knowledge by the subsequent researchers. we show that open science and secrecy are both potential equilibria, and that the feasibility of open science depends on factors such as the costs of accessing knowledge from prior generations and the relative benefits to private exploitation under secrecy versus disclosure. in parameter regions where both open science and secrecy can be supported, open science is associated with a higher level of social welfare. the analysis has policy implications for a number of areas, including public support for research training, appropriate design of formal intellectual property, and the role of scientific norms and institutions (such as an effective peer review process) in maintaining open science over the long run.

(3) querying capabilities with multiple levels of single study and institutional permissions, allowing public data sharing for all consented and de-identified subject data. (4) configurable pipelines and flags to facilitate acquisition and analysis, as well as access to high performance computing clusters for rapid data processing and sharing of software tools.

[7], all stages of the research process are influenced by the increasing use of the web 2.0 technologies. thus, scholarship in a digital age is influenced by different factors, such as networking, sharing of digital data, increased collaborative work and increased emphasis on openness. with in this background, digital literacy is becoming increasingly important, as scholars' use of digital tools builds their digital identity in this networked and collaborative world. according to costa \& torres [8], there is a need to promote new ways of collaborating and disseminating work as part of the digital presence, both at a personal as well as at an academic and professional level. therefore, the digital presence consists of building a digital identity in the various spaces the individual is connected with and this is no longer an individual process, but a process that somehow depends on their network. in this sense, digital literacy is more than being technically able to operate digital devices, it implies the use of several cognitive skills to perform specific tasks in digital environments. ``digital literacy has become a ``survival skill'' in the technological era-a key that helps users to work intuitively in executing complex digital tasks'' [9]. with the current analysis, we intend to understand the influence of the web 2.0 technologies in a 21st century scholarship, more particularly, how digital tools are used and help change the specific stages of scholarly practice.",identity,""

858,a multi-level classification framework for multi-site medical data: application to the adhd-200 collection,clinical decision support systems; decision trees; multi-level approach;; attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd),"recently, the culture of sharing medical data has emerged impressively, reducing significantly the barrier to the development of medical research accordingly. as open-access large datasets result from this significant initiative, data mining techniques can be considered for the development of interpretable expert systems to help in diagnosis. however, the collaborative effort of information gathering yields heterogeneous databases because of technical and geographical factors. indeed, on the one hand, the harmonization of protocols for data collection is still missing. on the other hand, cultural and social factors impact locally both the epidemiology and etiology of a given disease. ignoring these factors could weaken the credibility of studies based on multi-site data. thereby, our work tackles the development of computer aided diagnosis systems relying on heterogeneous data. for such a purpose, we propose a multi-level approach (inspired by multi-level statistical modeling) based on decision trees (in the sense of machine learning). this framework is applied on the public adhd-200 collection for the study of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd).

968,understanding the emergence of `open science' institutions: functionalist economics in historical context,"","this essay exposes the limitations of the `logical origins' approach that has found favour among economists who seek to understand the workings of institutions in the past and present. a different approach is pursued here, applying functionalism in historical context to explain the emergence of the characteristic ethos and institutions of `open science'. the emergence during the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries of the idea and practice of `open science' represented a break from the previously dominant ethos of secrecy in the pursuit of `nature's secrets'. it was a distinctive and vital organizational aspect of the scientific revolution, from which crystallized a new set of norms, incentives and organizational structures that reinforced scientific researchers' commitments to rapid disclosure of new knowledge. to understand how this came about, it is necessary to examine the economics of patronage and the roles of asymmetric information and reputation in the early modern reorganization of scientific activities. the rise of `cooperative rivalries' in the revelation of new knowledge is seen as a functional response to heightened asymmetric information problems posed for the renaissance system of court patronage of the arts and sciences; pre-existing informational asymmetries had been exacerbated by increased importance of mathematics and the greater reliance upon sophisticated mathematical techniques in a variety of practical contexts of application. analysis of the court patronage system of late renaissance europe, within which the new natural philosophers found their support, points to the significance of the feudal legacy of fragmented political authority in creating conditions of `common agency contracting in substitutes'. these conditions are shown to have been conducive to more favorable contract terms (especially with regard to autonomy and financial support) for the agent-client members of western europe's nascent scientific communities. some lessons may be drawn for contemporary science and technology policy debates, in which the open science mode of pursuing knowledge often seems to be viewed a robust concomitant of the power of scientific research techniques-whereas it is a fragile cultural legacy of western europe's history upon which rests the ascendancy of modern science as a driver of long-term economic growth.",technology; revolution; patronage; galileo; origins; system,10.1093/icc/dth023

1007,contribution of the open access modality to the impact of hybrid journals controlling by field and time effects,open access; open science; scholarly communication; hybrid journals;; citation advantage,"purpose: researchers are more likely to read and cite papers to which they have access than those that they cannot obtain. thus, the objective of this work is to analyze the contribution of the open access (oa) modality to the impact of hybrid journals. design/methodology/approach: the ``research articles'' in the year 2017 from 200 hybrid journals in four subject areas, and the citations received by such articles in the period 2017-2020 in the scopus database, were analyzed. the hybrid oa papers were compared with the paywalled ones. the journals were randomly selected from those with share of oa papers higher than some minimal value. more than 60 thousand research articles were analyzed in the sample, of which 24\% under the oa modality. findings: we obtain at journal level that cites per article in both hybrid modalities (oa and pay walled) strongly correlate. however, there is no correlation between the oa prevalence and cites per article. there is oa citation advantage in 80\% of hybrid journals. moreover, the oa citation advantage is consistent across fields and held in time. we obtain an oa citation advantage of 50\% in average, and higher than 37\% in half of the hybrid journals. finally, the oa citation advantage is higher in humanities than in science and social science. research limitations: some of the citation advantage is likely due to more access allows more people to read and hence cite articles they otherwise would not. however, causation is difficult to establish and there are many possible bias. several factors can affect the observed differences in citation rates. funder mandates can be one of them. funders are likely to have oa requirement, and well-funded studies are more likely to receive more citations than poorly funded studies. another discussed factor is the selection bias postulate, which suggests that authors choose only their most impactful studies to be open access. practical implications: for hybrid journals, the open access modality is positive, in the sense that it provides a greater number of potential readers. this in turn translates into a greater number of citations and an improvement in the position of the journal in the rankings by impact factor. for researchers it is also positive because it increases the potential number of readers and citations received. originality/value: our study refines previous results by comparing documents more similar to each other. although it does not examine the cause of the observed citation advantage, we find that it exists in a very large sample.",citation advantage; articles,10.2478/jdis-2022-0007

1010,"a reply from a `pracademic': it is not all mischief, and there is scope to educate budding authors",open-science; article writing; academic publishing; article rejection;; publication secrets,"problemification: some academics joined the profession from private sector late in their career. they are sometimes referred to fondly as practical academics or `pracademics' because they still work in private sector and also act as a visiting professor in academia. i sit on eight boards and chair nearly half of them, and serve on audit committees and hr remuneration committees. i am an example of a `pracademic', and my induction into academia was one sentence - publish or perish. in the private sector, induction can take up to a week. i had one minute. implications: the implication is that i had to find out what a peer-reviewed journal was and trip into the fact that some peer-reviewed journals are scams and others a rated. telling the difference in my initial years took its toll. i continually had to ask colleagues - is this journal real? eventually i realised the dhet list was a good starting point and i started submitting articles. i got more rejections than acceptances at first, with very little explanation. so i learnt nothing and did not know what to do to improve. i had to waste another thousand reviewer hours of time to learn what the requirement was. research writing is guided by a personal philosophy, and it is about what types of research issues one is inclined towards. for instance, some people are naturally inclined towards basic research and others towards applied research. others are more oriented towards theory building and testing types for the purpose of creating knowledge for the sake of knowledge. some others are pragmatic types or realist types and believe real-world problems do not come neatly packaged and are somewhat untidily in presentation calling for discretion or judgement on what to prioritise for research and how to carry out the research. some are scientist practitioners (evidence informed researchers) and others are practitioner-scientist (practice-led science). perhaps this kind of orientation to research is what early career researchers need initially; then, they can worry about reproducibility of research findings down the line after grounding themselves into the research space they perceive to belong to and where they feel invested. purpose: the purpose of this opinion article is to share my journey and sow some doubt in reply to the opinion piece circulated by efendic and van zyl. whilst i do agree with everything that is said in their article, i believe that there is additional information that needs to be considered. context is important. not all academics that submit articles have been in academia for many years. we need to do more to support budding authors. recommendations: we need to be much more helpful to budding authors than just publishing a page or two called author submission guidelines. these are mostly cosmetic style guides. if we want a higher quality submission and plenty of them - then i believe we need to educate our budding authors of the requirements. perhaps we need a detailed guide, similar in content and depth as the article of efendic and van zyl (2019). we could consider a podcast setting out the technical guidelines and statistical requirements. running courses on article publishing by the reviewers is important because that is from the horse's mouth. trust me; it is not just a case of sticking to the style guide. you need to really understand some of the under currents of article publishing, for example, quoting as many authors from that particular journal's list of articles as possible.","",10.4102/sajip.v45i0.1726

1067,modeling lake trophic state: a random forest approach,cyanobacteria; harmful algal blooms; national lakes assessment;; nutrients; open science,"productivity of lentic ecosystems is well studied, and it is widely accepted that as nutrient inputs increase, productivity increases and lakes transition from lower trophic state (e.g., oligotrophic) to higher trophic states (e.g., eutrophic). these broad trophic state classifications are good predictors of ecosystem condition, services (e.g., recreation and esthetics), and disservices (e.g., harmful algal blooms). while the relationship between nutrients and trophic state provides reliable predictions, it requires in situ water quality data to parameterize the model. this limits the application of these models to lakes with existing and, more importantly, available water quality data. to address this, we take advantage of the availability of a large national lakes water quality database (i.e., the national lakes assessment), land-use/land-cover data, lake morphometry data, and other universally available data, and we apply data-mining approaches to predict trophic state. using these data and random forests, we first model chlorophyll a and then classify the resultant predictions into trophic states. the full model estimates chlorophyll a with both in situ and universally available data. the mean-squared error and adjusted r-2 of this model was 0.09 and 0.8, respectively. the second model uses universally available gis data only. the mean-squared error was 0.22, and the adjusted r-2 was 0.48. the kappa coefficients of the trophic state classifications derived from the chlorophyll a predictions were 0.57 for the full model and 0.29 for the gis-only model. random forests extend the usefulness of the class predictions by providing prediction probabilities for each lake. this allows us to make trophic state predictions and also indicate the level of uncertainty around those predictions. for the full model, these predicted class probabilities ranged from 0.42 to 1. for the gis-only model, they ranged from 0.33 to 0.96. it is our conclusion that in situ data are required for better predictions, yet gis and universally available data provide trophic state predictions, with estimated uncertainty, that still have the potential for a broad array of applications. the source code and data for this manuscript are available from .",land-cover database; water-quality; fresh-water; eutrophication;; classification; agreement; nutrient; marine; tool,10.1002/ecs2.1321

1292,large-scale evaluation of ants and freesurfer cortical thickness measurements,advanced normalization tools; age prediction; mri; gender prediction;; open science; scientific reproducibility,"many studies of the human brain have explored the relationship between cortical thickness and cognition, phenotype, or disease. due to the subjectivity and time requirements in manual measurement of cortical thickness, scientists have relied on robust software tools for automation which facilitate the testing and refinement of neuroscientific hypotheses. the most widely used tool for cortical thickness studies is the publicly available, surface-based freesurfer package. critical to the adoption of such tools is a demonstration of their reproducibility, validity, and the documentation of specific implementations that are robust across large, diverse imaging datasets. to this end, we have developed the automated, volume-based advanced normalization tools (ants) cortical thickness pipeline comprising well-vetted components such as sygn (multivariate template construction), syn (image registration), n4 (bias correction), atropos (n-tissue segmentation), and direct (cortical thickness estimation). in this work, we have conducted the largest evaluation of automated cortical thickness measures in publicly available data, comparing freesurfer and ants measures computed on 1205 images from four open data sets (ixi, mmrr, nki, and oasis), with parcellation based on the recently proposed desikan-killiany-tourville (dkt) cortical labeling protocol. we found good scan rescan repeatability with both freesurfer and ants measures. given that such assessments of precision do not necessarily reflect accuracy or an ability to make statistical inferences, we further tested the neurobiological validity of these approaches by evaluating thickness-based prediction of age and gender. ants is shown to have a higher predictive performance than freesurfer for both of these measures. in promotion of open science, we make all of our scripts, data, and results publicly available which complements the use of open image data sets and the open source availability of the proposed ants cortical thickness pipeline.

1301,best practices for reporting individual identification using camera trap photographs,data management; open science; mark-recapture; population modeling;; wildlife monitoring; journal policy,"camera traps have become a popular sampling tool in ecological studies. this is especially true for studies that estimate population densities through spatial capture-recapture models of species with physical traits allowing individual identification. however, misidentification is a potential problem when trying to identify individuals from photographs. researchers need rigorous methods for checking and rectifying errors, handling unclassifiable photographs and resolving inter-observer discrepancies to prevent or reduce misidentification. through a systematic review of both traditional and spatial capture-recapture studies, we found that few studies described the methods used to avoid individual misidentification; moreover, most studies did not provide photographic evidence that individuals could be reliably differentiated. this lack of transparency and accountability prevents reviewers and readers from assessing the reliability and robustness of the studies, and falls short of the standards of reporting compared to other fields of research such as biomedical or genomic research. to address this problem, we present an individual identification reporting checklist (iirc) listing minimum standards for reporting methods and photographic data for individual identification, which are necessary evidence in publications that rely on accurate individual identification from camera trap photographs. by adopting the iirc, researchers will enhance the credibility of capture-recapture studies, facilitate information transfer among researchers, and improve the progress of downstream research and conservation efforts reliant on accurate photographic identification. we acknowledge that photographic data may be associated with heightened poaching risks. however, in the context of capture-recapture studies, we argue that frequently published information such as study site locations and abundance estimates carry much higher risks of poaching, while the additional threats incurred from the inclusion of photographic information are likely to be marginal and can be mitigated.

1420,when data sharing gets close to 100\%: what human paleogenetics can teach the open science movement,"","this study analyzes data sharing regarding mitochondrial, y chromosomal and autosomal polymorphisms in a total of 162 papers on ancient human dna published between 1988 and 2013. the estimated sharing rate was not far from totality (97.6\% +/- 2.1\%) and substantially higher than observed in other fields of genetic research (evolutionary, medical and forensic genetics). both a questionnaire-based survey and the examination of journals' editorial policies suggest that this high sharing rate cannot be simply explained by the need to comply with stakeholders requests. most data were made available through body text, but the use of primary databases increased in coincidence with the introduction of complete mitochondrial and next-generation sequencing methods. our study highlights three important aspects. first, our results imply that researchers' awareness of the importance of openness and transparency for scientific progress may complement stakeholders' policies in achieving very high sharing rates. second, widespread data sharing does not necessarily coincide with a prevalent use of practices which maximize data findability, accessibility, useability and preservation. a detailed look at the different ways in which data are released can be very useful to detect failures to adopt the best sharing modalities and understand how to correct them. third and finally, the case of human paleogenetics tells us that a widespread awareness of the importance of open science may be important to build reliable scientific practices even in the presence of complex experimental challenges.",ancient; society; availability; genetics; future; dna,10.1371/journal.pone.0121409
1421,an open science and open data approach for the statistically robust estimation of forest disturbance areas,forest disturbance; change detection; clear-cut; sentinel-2; climate; change,"forest disturbance monitoring is critical for understanding forest-related greenhouse gas emissions and for determining the role of forest management in mitigating climate change. multiple algorithms for the automated mapping of forest disturbance using remotely sensed imagery have been developed and applied; however, variability in natural and anthropogenic disturbance phenomena, as well as image acquisition conditions, can result in maps that may be incomplete or that contain inaccuracies that prevent their use for directly estimating areas of disturbance. to reduce errors in reporting disturbance areas, stratified estimators can be applied to obtain statistically robust area estimates, while simultaneously circumventing the need to conduct a complete census or in situations where such a census may not be possible. we present a semi-automated procedure for implementation in google earth engine, 3i3d-gee, for regional to global mapping of forest disturbance (including clear-cut harvesting, fire, and wind damage) and sample-based estimation of related areas using data from the processing capacity of google earth engine. documentation for the application is also provided in appendix a. using sentinel-2 (52) imagery, our procedure was applied and tested for 2018 in italy for which the approximately 11 million ha of forests (mostly q. pubescens, q. robur, q. cerris, q. petraea, and fagus sylvatica) serve as an appropriate case study because national statistics on forest disturbance areas are not available. to decrease the overall standard errors of the area estimates, the sampling intensities in areas where greater variability in the form of greater commission and omission errors are expected can be increased. to this end, we augmented the predicted forest disturbance map with a buffer class consisting of a two-pixel buffer (20 m) on each side of the disturbance class boundary. we selected a reference sample of 19,300 points: a simple random sample of 9,300 points from the buffer and simple random samples of 5000 from each of the undisturbed and disturbed classes. the reference sample was photointerpreted using fine resolution orthophotos (30 cm) and 52 imagery. while the estimate of the disturbed area obtained by adding the areas of pixels classified as disturbed was 41,732 ha, the estimate obtained using the unbiased stratified estimator was 27\% greater at 57,717 +/- 716 ha. regarding map accuracy, we found several omission errors in the buffer (53.4\%) but none (0\%) in the undisturbed map class. similarly, among the 1035 commission errors, the majority (744) were in the buffer class. the methods presented herein provide a useful tool that can be used to estimate areas of forest disturbance, which many nations must report as part of their commitment to international conventions and treaties. in addition, the information generated can support forest management, enabling the forest sector to monitor stand-replacing forest harvesting over space and time.",landsat time-series; accuracy; classification; inventories; resilience;; biomass; plots,10.1016/j.jag.2021.102663

1474,replication in field ecology: identifying challenges and proposing solutions,confidence in science; experimental design; field ecology; open science;; repeatability; replication; reproducibility crisis,"1. field ecology has been included in a `replication crisis' that extends across many scientific disciplines. however, the underlying concepts of replication, reproducibility and replicability are not always clearly distinguished, and complicate the identification of best practices. furthermore, conducting experiments under the high variability of natural field conditions reduces the capacity for replication relative to other biological disciplines working under controlled conditions. field ecologists are therefore facing a significant challenge in assessing the replicability of their research with implications for overall confidence in study outcomes. 2. through a review of the literature, we discuss several related aspects of experimental design that can enhance confidence in scientific outcomes. specifically, we describe sample replication (repeat sample), within-study replication (repeat experiment) and between-study replication (repeat study) and how each can be used within field ecology. since perfect between-study replication (i.e. direct replication) is generally not possible in field ecology, we suggest more explicit use of conceptual replication would enhance confidence in scientific outcomes. however, such changes require cultural shifts in practice among all participants in the scientific enterprise. 3. we suggest several tangible steps could be taken to improve confidence in ecological research: (a) increase the use of within-study replication before publication, (b) increase replicability for aspects that we can control (e.g. pre-register experiments, open data, publish code), (c) divest from novelty as the primary criterion for publication in leading ecological journals and invest in experimental design, (d) be sceptical of contradictory findings from studies testing similar research questions and (e) create a publishing environment that encourages more conceptual replication studies. 4. we believe adopting these practices will increase the confidence in results for field ecology. there are critical obstacles that could prevent some scientists from increasing within-study or between-study replication, including short-term funding mechanisms and the prospect of fewer publications. we suggest strategies to mitigate negative impacts to researchers, such as leading journals piloting new article categories and explicit mention of experimentally linked studies. we acknowledge that adopting greater replication in field ecology will require significant changes to cultural practices, but there are clear benefits for improving our confidence in science.",behavioral ecology; metaanalysis; science; reproducibility;; productivity; pseudoreplication; transparency; incentives,10.1111/2041-210x.13657

(ii) an a priori power calculation should be carried out. (iii) the experimental study protocol should be pre-registered. (iv) the execution of the study should be in accordance with the most recent arrive guidelines. (v) when planning the study, the generalizability of the data to be collected should also be considered (e.g., sex or age differences). (vi) ``method-hopping'' should be avoided, meaning that it is not necessary to use the most advanced technology but rather to have the applied methodology under control. (vii) national or international networks should be considered to carry out multicenter preclinical studies or to obtain convergent evidence. (viii) animal models that capture dsm-5 or icd-11 criteria should be considered in the context of research on psychiatric disorders. (ix) raw data of publication should be made publicly available and should be in accordance with the fair guiding principles for scientific data management. (x) finally, negative findings should be published to counteract publication bias. the application of these 10 points of recommendation, especially for preclinical confirmatory studies but also to some degree for exploratory studies, will ultimately improve the reproducibility and translation of animal research.",corticotropin-releasing-factor; placebo-controlled trial; antagonist;; models; metaanalysis; guidelines; behavior; women; cell; nih,10.3389/fnbeh.2022.869511

(2021) proposed to address the dark taxon impediment for costa rican braconid wasps by describing 403 species based on coi barcode clusters (''bins'') computed by bold systems. more than 99\% of the bins (387 of 390) were converted into species by assigning binominal names (e.g. bin ``bold:acm9419'' becomes bracon federicomatarritai) and adding a minimal diagnosis (consisting only of a consensus barcode for most species). we here show that many of sharkey et al.'s species are unstable when the underlying data are analyzed using different species delimitation algorithms. add the insufficiently informative diagnoses, and many of these species will become the next ``superficial description impediment'' for braconid taxonomy because they will have to be tested and redescribed after obtaining sufficient evidence for confidently delimiting species. we furthermore show that sharkey et al.'s approach of using consensus barcodes as diagnoses is not functional because it cannot be applied consistently. lastly, we reiterate that coi alone is not suitable for delimiting and describing species, and voice concerns over sharkey et al.'s uncritical use of bins because they are calculated by a proprietary algorithm (resl) that uses a mixture of public and private data. we urge authors, reviewers and editors to maintain high standards in taxonomy by only publishing new species that are rigorously delimited with open-access tools and supported by publicly available evidence.",species delimitation method; parasitoid flies diptera; dna barcodes;; conservacion guanacaste; taxonomy; morphology; sepsidae; genus;; identification; tachinidae,10.1111/cla.12489

1897,"a review on utilizing machine learning technology in the fields of electronic emergency triage and patient priority systems in telemedicine: coherent taxonomy, motivations, open research challenges and recommendations for intelligent future work",artificial intelligence; healthcare monitoring; mhealth; triage; sensor;; data mining; big data,"background: with the remarkable increasing in the numbers of patients, the triaging and prioritizing patients into multi-emergency level is required to accommodate all the patients, save more lives, and manage the medical resources effectively. triaging and prioritizing patients becomes particularly challenging especially for the patients who are far from hospital and use telemedicine system. to this end, the researchers exploiting the useful tool of machine learning to address this challenge. hence, carrying out an intensive investigation and in-depth study in the field of using machine learning in e-triage and patient priority are essential and required. objectives: this research aims to (1) provide a literature review and an in-depth study on the roles of machine learning in the fields of electronic emergency triage (e-triage) and prioritize patients for fast healthcare services in telemedicine applications. (2) highlight the effectiveness of machine learning methods in terms of algorithms, medical input data, output results, and machine learning goals in remote healthcare telemedicine systems. (3) present the relationship between machine learning goals and the electronic triage processes specifically on the: triage levels, medical features for input, outcome results as outputs, and the relevant diseases. (4), the outcomes of our analyses are subjected to organize and propose a cross-over taxonomy between machine learning algorithms and telemedicine structure. (5) present lists of motivations, open research challenges and recommendations for future intelligent work for both academic and industrial sectors in telemedicine and remote healthcare applications. methods: an intensive research is carried out by reviewing all articles related to the field of e-triage and remote priority systems that utilise machine learning algorithms and sensors. we have searched all related keywords to investigate the databases of science direct, ieee xplore, web of science, pubmed, and medline for the articles, which have been published from january 2012 up to date. results: a new crossover matching between machine learning methods and telemedicine taxonomy is proposed. the crossover-taxonomy is developed in this study to identify the relationship between machine learning algorithm and the equivalent telemedicine categories whereas the machine learning algorithm has been utilized. the impact of utilizing machine learning is composed in proposing the telemedicine architecture based on synchronous (real-time/ online) and asynchronous (store-and-forward / offline) structure. in addition to that, list of machine learning algorithms, list of the performance metrics, list of inputs data and outputs results are presented. moreover, open research challenges, the benefits of utilizing machine learning and the recommendations for new research opportunities that need to be addressed for the synergistic integration of multidisciplinary works are organized and presented accordingly. discussion: the state-of-the-art studies on the e-triage and priority systems that utilise machine learning algorithms in telemedicine architecture are discussed. this approach allows the researchers to understand the modernisation of healthcare systems and the efficient use of artificial intelligence and machine learning. in particular, the growing worldwide population and various chronic diseases such as heart chronic diseases, blood pressure and diabetes, require smart health monitoring systems in e-triage and priority systems, in which machine learning algorithms could be greatly beneficial. conclusions: although research directions on e-triage and priority systems that use machine learning algorithms in telemedicine vary, they are equally essential and should be considered. hence, we provide a comprehensive review to emphasise the advantages of the existing research in multidisciplinary works of artificial intelligence, machine learning and healthcare services.
