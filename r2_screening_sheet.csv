OF CENTRAL PRIORITY ARE PROPOSALS FOR IMPROVING RESEARCH INTEGRITY AND QUALITY, AS WELL AS GUIDANCE AND SUPPORT FOR RESEARCHERS. IN RESPONSE TO THIS, WE ARGUE THAT THERE IS ONE IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF RESEARCH INTEGRITY THAT IS OFTEN ABSENT FROM DISCUSSION: THE PEDAGOGICAL CONSEQUENCES OF HOW WE TEACH, MENTOR, AND SUPERVISE STUDENTS THROUGH OPEN SCHOLARSHIP. WE JUSTIFY THE NEED TO INTEGRATE OPEN SCHOLARSHIP PRINCIPLES INTO RESEARCH TRAINING WITHIN HIGHER EDUCATION AND ARGUE THAT PEDAGOGICAL COMMUNITIES PLAY A KEY ROLE IN FOSTERING AN INCLUSIVE CULTURE OF OPEN SCHOLARSHIP. WE ILLUSTRATE THESE BENEFITS BY PRESENTING THE FRAMEWORK FOR OPEN AND REPRODUCIBLE RESEARCH TRAINING (FORRT), AN INTERNATIONAL GRASSROOTS COMMUNITY WHOSE GOAL IS TO PROVIDE SUPPORT, RESOURCES, VISIBILITY, AND ADVOCACY FOR THE ADOPTION OF PRINCIPLED, OPEN TEACHING AND MENTORING PRACTICES, WHILST GENERATING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE ETHICS AND SOCIAL IMPACT OF HIGHER-EDUCATION PEDAGOGY.

THE RWANDAN LIBRARIANS SEE RESEARCHERS AS CHALLENGED THROUGH THE PRESSURES ON THEM TO PUBLISH, THE COSTS OF RESEARCH, POOR INFRASTRUCTURE, LACK OF SKILLS AND LIMITED ACCESS TO LITERATURE. COLLECTIVELY THESE CHALLENGES CONSTITUTE A CRITICAL BARRIER TO RESEARCH. THESE LIMITS FIT LARGELY THE COUNTRY DEFICIT PERSPECTIVE.

RESEARCHERS AND INSTITUTIONS HAVE PROPOSED OPEN SCIENCE PRACTICES (OSPS) TO IMPROVE THE DETECTABILITY OF QRPS AND THE CREDIBILITY OF SCIENCE. WE EXAMINE THE PREVALENCE OF QRPS AND OSPS IN CRIMINOLOGY, AND RESEARCHERS' OPINIONS OF THOSE PRACTICES. METHODS WE ADMINISTERED AN ANONYMOUS SURVEY TO AUTHORS OF ARTICLES PUBLISHED IN CRIMINOLOGY JOURNALS. RESPONDENTS SELF-REPORTED THEIR OWN USE OF 10 QRPS AND 5 OSPS. THEY ALSO ESTIMATED THE PREVALENCE OF USE BY OTHERS, AND REPORTED THEIR ATTITUDES TOWARD THE PRACTICES. RESULTS QRPS AND OSPS ARE BOTH COMMON IN QUANTITATIVE CRIMINOLOGY, ABOUT AS COMMON AS THEY ARE IN OTHER FIELDS. CRIMINOLOGISTS WHO RESPONDED TO OUR SURVEY SUPPORT USING QRPS IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES, BUT ARE EVEN MORE SUPPORTIVE OF USING OSPS. WE DID NOT DETECT A SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN METHODOLOGICAL TRAINING AND EITHER QRP OR OSP USE. SUPPORT FOR QRPS IS NEGATIVELY AND SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH SUPPORT FOR OSPS. PERCEIVED PREVALENCE ESTIMATES FOR SOME PRACTICES RESEMBLED A UNIFORM DISTRIBUTION, SUGGESTING CRIMINOLOGISTS HAVE LITTLE KNOWLEDGE OF THE PROPORTION OF RESEARCHERS THAT ENGAGE IN CERTAIN QUESTIONABLE PRACTICES. CONCLUSIONS MOST QUANTITATIVE CRIMINOLOGISTS IN OUR SAMPLE HAVE USED QRPS, AND MANY HAVE USED MULTIPLE QRPS. MOREOVER, THERE WAS SUBSTANTIAL SUPPORT FOR QRPS, RAISING QUESTIONS ABOUT THE VALIDITY AND REPRODUCIBILITY OF PUBLISHED CRIMINOLOGICAL RESEARCH. WE FOUND PROMISING LEVELS OF OSP USE, ALBEIT AT LEVELS LAGGING WHAT RESEARCHERS ENDORSE.

METHODS: THE MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE FOR OUR STUDY IS THE LEVEL OF OS IN JOB ADVERTISEMENTS, ASSESSED USING THE MODIFIED OPEN SCIENCE MODULAR SCHEME. RESULTS: AFTER ASSESSING 305 JOB ADVERTISEMENTS FOR ACADEMIC POSITIONS IN 91 INSTITUTIONS, ONLY 2 (0.6\%) HAD ANY EXPLICIT MENTION OF OS IN THEIR JOB ADVERTISEMENTS ON THE MODIFIED OPEN SCIENCE MODULAR SCHEME.

THE EXTENT THAT PHYSICAL ACTIVITY INTERVENTIONS ARE EMBEDDING OPEN SCIENCE PRACTICES IS CURRENTLY UNKNOWN. IN THIS STUDY, WE RANDOMLY SAMPLED 100 REPORTS OF RECENT PHYSICAL ACTIVITY RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL BEHAVIOUR CHANGE INTERVENTIONS TO ESTIMATE THE PREVALENCE OF OPEN SCIENCE PRACTICES. METHODS ONE HUNDRED REPORTS OF RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL PHYSICAL ACTIVITY BEHAVIOUR CHANGE INTERVENTIONS PUBLISHED BETWEEN 2018 AND 2021 WERE IDENTIFIED, AS USED WITHIN THE HUMAN BEHAVIOUR-CHANGE PROJECT. OPEN SCIENCE PRACTICES WERE CODED IN IDENTIFIED REPORTS, INCLUDING: STUDY PRE-REGISTRATION, PROTOCOL SHARING, DATA, MATERIALS AND ANALYSIS SCRIPTS SHARING, REPLICATION OF A PREVIOUS STUDY, OPEN ACCESS PUBLICATION, FUNDING SOURCES AND CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENTS. CODING WAS PERFORMED BY TWO INDEPENDENT RESEARCHERS, WITH INTER-RATER RELIABILITY CALCULATED USING KRIPPENDORFF'S ALPHA. RESULTS 78 OF THE 100 REPORTS PROVIDED DETAILS OF STUDY PRE-REGISTRATION AND 41\% PROVIDED EVIDENCE OF A PUBLISHED PROTOCOL. 4\% PROVIDED ACCESSIBLE OPEN DATA, 8\% PROVIDED OPEN MATERIALS AND 1\% PROVIDED OPEN ANALYSIS SCRIPTS. 73\% OF REPORTS WERE PUBLISHED AS OPEN ACCESS AND NO STUDIES WERE DESCRIBED AS REPLICATION ATTEMPTS. 93\% OF REPORTS DECLARED THEIR SOURCES OF FUNDING AND 88\% PROVIDED CONFLICTS OF INTEREST STATEMENTS. A KRIPPENDORFF'S ALPHA OF 0.73 WAS OBTAINED ACROSS ALL CODING. CONCLUSION OPEN DATA, MATERIALS, ANALYSIS AND REPLICATION ATTEMPTS ARE CURRENTLY RARE IN PHYSICAL ACTIVITY BEHAVIOUR CHANGE INTERVENTION REPORTS, WHEREAS FUNDING SOURCE AND CONFLICT OF INTEREST DECLARATIONS ARE COMMON.

IN MANY CASES, THE REALITIES OF DATA ACQUISITION PRESENT A SIGNIFICANT BURDEN, THEREFORE GAINING ACCESS TO PUBLIC DATASETS ALLOWS FOR MORE ROBUST ANALYSES AND BROADLY ENRICHED DATA EXPLORATION. TO ANSWER THIS DEMAND, THE MONTREAL NEUROLOGICAL INSTITUTE HAS ANNOUNCED ITS COMMITMENT TO OPEN SCIENCE, HARNESSING THE POWER OF MAKING BOTH CLINICAL AND RESEARCH DATA AVAILABLE TO THE WORLD (OWENS, 2016A,B). AS SUCH, THE LORIS AND CBRAIN (DAS ET AL., 2016) PLATFORMS HAVE BEEN TASKED WITH THE TECHNICAL CHALLENGES SPECIFIC TO THE INSTITUTIONAL-LEVEL IMPLEMENTATION OF OPEN DATA SHARING, INCLUDING: (1) COMPREHENSIVE LINKING OF MULTIMODAL DATA (PHENOTYPIC, CLINICAL, NEUROIMAGING, BIOBANKING, AND GENOMICS, ETC.) (2) SECURE DATABASE ENCRYPTION, SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED FOR INSTITUTIONAL AND MULTI-PROJECT DATA SHARING, ENSURING SUBJECT CONFIDENTIALITY (USING MULTI-TIERED IDENTIFIERS). (3) QUERYING CAPABILITIES WITH MULTIPLE LEVELS OF SINGLE STUDY AND INSTITUTIONAL PERMISSIONS, ALLOWING PUBLIC DATA SHARING FOR ALL CONSENTED AND DE-IDENTIFIED SUBJECT DATA. (4) CONFIGURABLE PIPELINES AND FLAGS TO FACILITATE ACQUISITION AND ANALYSIS, AS WELL AS ACCESS TO HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING CLUSTERS FOR RAPID DATA PROCESSING AND SHARING OF SOFTWARE TOOLS. (5) ROBUST WORKFLOWS AND QUALITY CONTROL MECHANISMS ENSURING TRANSPARENCY AND CONSISTENCY IN BEST PRACTICES. (6) LONG TERM STORAGE (AND WEB ACCESS) OF DATA, REDUCING LOSS OF INSTITUTIONAL DATA ASSETS. (7) ENHANCED WEB-BASED VISUALIZATION OF IMAGING, GENOMIC, AND PHENOTYPIC DATA, ALLOWING FOR REAL-TIME VIEWING AND MANIPULATION OF DATA FROM ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD.

RESPONSES HAVE VARIED FROM CONSERVATIVE TO RADICALLY INNOVATIVE. UNIVERSALLY, THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC DISRUPTED AND SHOCKED SOCIETIES WORLDWIDE, AND EDUCATION SYSTEMS WERE ON THE FRONT LINE. THE LOCKDOWNS LARGELY STOPPED FACE-TO-FACE AND FORMAL EDUCATION IN ALMOST ALL COUNTRIES, AND IN MOST CASES, DISTANCE LEARNING SOON BECAME THE `NEW NORMAL'. A CENTRAL CHALLENGE CONCERNED SUSTAINING EDUCATIONAL VISIONS AND IDEALS IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES.

THE AUTHORS ARGUE THAT PARTICIPATORY DESIGN IS A GOOD WAY TO CREATE THESE SHARED CONCEPTUALIZATIONS BY GIVING DOMAIN EXPERTS AND FUTURE USERS A VOICE IN THE DESIGN PROCESS VIA INTERVIEWS, WORKSHOPS AND OBSERVATIONS. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THIS PAPER PRESENTS A NOVEL APPROACH FOR CREATING ONTOLOGIES IN THE FIELD OF OPEN SCIENCE USING PARTICIPATORY DESIGN. AS A CASE STUDY THE CREATION OF AN ONTOLOGY FOR QUALITATIVE CODING SCHEMAS IS PRESENTED. CODING SCHEMAS ARE AN IMPORTANT RESULT OF QUALITATIVE RESEARCH, AND REUSE CAN YIELD GREAT POTENTIAL FOR OPEN SCIENCE MAKING QUALITATIVE RESEARCH MORE TRANSPARENT, ENHANCE SHARING OF CODING SCHEMAS AND TEACHING OF QUALITATIVE METHODS. THE PARTICIPATORY DESIGN PROCESS CONSISTED OF THREE PARTS: A REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS USING INTERVIEWS AND AN OBSERVATION, A DESIGN PHASE ACCOMPANIED BY INTERVIEWS AND AN EVALUATION PHASE BASED ON USER TESTS AS WELL AS INTERVIEWS. FINDINGS THE RESEARCH SHOWED SEVERAL POSITIVE OUTCOMES DUE TO PARTICIPATORY DESIGN: HIGHER COMMITMENT OF USERS, MUTUAL LEARNING, HIGH QUALITY FEEDBACK AND BETTER QUALITY OF THE ONTOLOGY.

WE DETERMINED THAT THE ORKG READILY PROVIDES SOCIAL AND FINANCIAL INCENTIVES, FEEDBACK ELICITATION CHANNELS, AND SUPPORT FOR CONTEXT AND USAGE MONITORING, BUT THAT THERE IS IMPROVEMENT POTENTIAL REGARDING AUTOMATED USER FEEDBACK ANALYSES AND A HOLISTIC CROWDRE APPROACH. (2) AS CROWD MEMBERS, WE EXPLORE HOW THE ORKG CAN BE USED TO COMMUNICATE SCHOLARLY KNOWLEDGE ABOUT CROWDRE RESEARCH. FOR THIS PURPOSE, WE CURATED QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE SCHOLARLY KNOWLEDGE IN THE ORKG BASED ON PAPERS CONTAINED IN TWO PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEWS (SLRS) ON CROWDRE. THIS KNOWLEDGE CAN BE EXPLORED AND COMPARED INTERACTIVELY, AND WITH MORE DATA THAN WHAT THE SLRS ORIGINALLY CONTAINED.

SUCH CHALLENGES ARE COMPOUNDED FOR THOSE IN EARLY STAGES OF THEIR CAREER, WHERE DATA COLLECTION AND NETWORKING ARE VITAL TO BE SEEN AS PRODUCTIVE. HOWEVER, DURING THIS TRYING TIME OF REMOTE WORK, WE, AS A COLLECTIVE OF EARLY-CAREER OCEANOGRAPHERS, WERE ACTIVELY DEVELOPING AND IMPROVING ON AN ALREADY-EXISTENT HYBRID COMMUNITY OF PRACTICE. THROUGH OUR EXPERIENCES, WE BELIEVE THIS TYPE OF FRAMEWORK CAN ENHANCE VIRTUAL COLLABORATION TO THE POINT THAT IT OUTLASTS THE PANDEMIC AND HELPS CREATE NEW SYNERGIES THAT WILL DIVERSIFY AND ENHANCE SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY WITHIN THE OCEAN SCIENCE COMMUNITY. WE DESCRIBE A HYBRID COMMUNITY OF PRACTICE AND AN EXAMPLE WORKFLOW THAT MODELS EFFECTIVE COLLABORATION.

IN OUR EXPERIENCE, BOTH THE IN-PERSON AND REMOTE ASPECTS OF THE MODEL ARE IMPORTANT. IN PERSON COLLABORATION IS KEY TO EXPANDING THE COMMUNITY OF PRACTICE AND INVIGORATING THOSE ALREADY WITHIN THE COMMUNITY.

IN ORDER TO SHOW THAT, WE ADOPT A SCHUMPETERIAN GROWTH MODEL WHERE THE RESOURCES ALLOCATED TO SCIENCE ARE ENDOGENOUSLY DETERMINED WITHIN THE ECONOMY AND SCIENCE IS ORGANISED ACCORDING TO THE INSTITUTION OF ``OPEN SCIENCE''. THIS LATTER CONSISTS IN A SELF-REINFORCING CODE OF CONDUCT, WHICH COMPRISES AN INCENTIVE SCHEME BASED ON THE PRIORITY RULE, AND ON THE PRESENCE OF BOTH REAL REWARDS AND SOCIAL REWARDS. SOCIAL REWARDS TAKE TWO MAIN FORMS ACCORDING TO THE SOURCE CONCERNED: ONE IS THE SOCIAL REWARD DERIVING FROM MAJOR INNOVATIONS; ANOTHER CONSISTS IN HIGH REPUTATION ENJOYED BY RESEARCHERS WHO PUT A HIGH LEVEL OF EFFORT INTO THEIR JOB, AND DEVOTE THEMSELVES TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE. THIS SET OF RULES CAUSES THE EMERGENCE OF TWO LOCALLY STABLE STEADY-STATES: A LOW EQUILIBRIUM, WHERE THE ECONOMY IS ENDOWED WITH A SMALL SCIENCE SECTOR; AND A HIGH EQUILIBRIUM, WHERE THE ECONOMY HAS A LARGE SCIENCE SECTOR WITH RAPID KNOWLEDGE ADVANCEMENT. THE TWO EQUILIBRIA CAN ACCOUNT FOR THE HUGE DIFFERENCES CURRENTLY EXISTING BETWEEN SCIENTIFIC SECTORS OF MORE DEVELOPED AND LESS DEVELOPED COUNTRIES. COMPARATIVE STATIC RESULTS FURTHER CHARACTERISE THE TWO EQUILIBRIA, SINCE MONETARY AND SOCIAL REWARDS HAVE DIFFERENT EFFECTS ACCORDING TO THE TYPE OF EQUILIBRIUM THAT EMERGES. (C) 2014 ELSEVIER B.V.

THIS PAPER DISCUSSES HOW THE SOCIAL, NETWORKED AND PARTICIPATORY CHARACTERISTICS OF THE WEB 2.0 INFLUENCE THE ROLE OF SCHOLARS AND SCHOLARLY PRACTICE IN A 21ST CENTURY REALITY. TWO IMPORTANT CONCEPTS EMERGE FROM THIS ANALYSIS: THE NOTIONS OF SCHOLARSHIP AND DIGITAL LITERACY. IN THIS CONTEXT, SCHOLARSHIP IS ANALYSED IN BOYER'S [1] PERSPECTIVE OF THE SCHOLARSHIP OF DISCOVERY, TRADITIONALLY REFERRING TO THE ACTIVITIES CARRIED OUT BY SCHOLARS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES. THE CURRENT USE OF DIGITAL TOOLS HAS BEEN SHAPING THE RESEARCH WORK OF SCHOLARS IN DIFFERENT WAYS, IN WHAT HAS BEEN TERMED AS SOCIAL SCHOLARSHIP [2], OPEN SCHOLARSHIP [3,4], DIGITAL OPEN SCHOLARSHIP [5] AND NETWORKED PARTICIPATORY SCHOLARSHIP [6]. TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE SCHOLARLY COMMUNICATION CYCLE PROPOSED BY CZERNIEWICZ ET AL. [7], ALL STAGES OF THE RESEARCH PROCESS ARE INFLUENCED BY THE INCREASING USE OF THE WEB 2.0 TECHNOLOGIES. THUS, SCHOLARSHIP IN A DIGITAL AGE IS INFLUENCED BY DIFFERENT FACTORS, SUCH AS NETWORKING, SHARING OF DIGITAL DATA, INCREASED COLLABORATIVE WORK AND INCREASED EMPHASIS ON OPENNESS. WITH IN THIS BACKGROUND, DIGITAL LITERACY IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT, AS SCHOLARS' USE OF DIGITAL TOOLS BUILDS THEIR DIGITAL IDENTITY IN THIS NETWORKED AND COLLABORATIVE WORLD. ACCORDING TO COSTA \& TORRES [8], THERE IS A NEED TO PROMOTE NEW WAYS OF COLLABORATING AND DISSEMINATING WORK AS PART OF THE DIGITAL PRESENCE, BOTH AT A PERSONAL AS WELL AS AT AN ACADEMIC AND PROFESSIONAL LEVEL. THEREFORE, THE DIGITAL PRESENCE CONSISTS OF BUILDING A DIGITAL IDENTITY IN THE VARIOUS SPACES THE INDIVIDUAL IS CONNECTED WITH AND THIS IS NO LONGER AN INDIVIDUAL PROCESS, BUT A PROCESS THAT SOMEHOW DEPENDS ON THEIR NETWORK. IN THIS SENSE, DIGITAL LITERACY IS MORE THAN BEING TECHNICALLY ABLE TO OPERATE DIGITAL DEVICES, IT IMPLIES THE USE OF SEVERAL COGNITIVE SKILLS TO PERFORM SPECIFIC TASKS IN DIGITAL ENVIRONMENTS. ``DIGITAL LITERACY HAS BECOME A ``SURVIVAL SKILL'' IN THE TECHNOLOGICAL ERA-A KEY THAT HELPS USERS TO WORK INTUITIVELY IN EXECUTING COMPLEX DIGITAL TASKS'' [9].

THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO ASSESS THE DEGREE OF OPENNESS OF SCIENTIFIC ARTICLES ON BIOECONOMY, AS ONE OF THE EMERGENT RESEARCH FIELDS AT THE CROSSROADS OF SEVERAL DISCIPLINES AND WITH HIGH SOCIETAL AND INDUSTRIAL IMPACT. BASED ON A WEB OF SCIENCE (WOS) CORPUS OF 2489 ARTICLES PUBLISHED BETWEEN 2015 AND 2019, WE CALCULATED BIBLIOMETRIC INDICATORS, EXPLORED THE OPENNESS OF EACH ARTICLE AND ASSESSED THE SHARE OF JOURNALS, COUNTRIES AND RESEARCH AREAS OF THESE ARTICLES. THE RESULTS SHOW A SHARP INCREASE AND DIVERSIFICATION OF ARTICLES IN THE FIELD OF BIOECONOMY, WITH A BEGINNING LONG TAIL DISTRIBUTION. 45.6\% OF THE ARTICLES ARE FREELY AVAILABLE AND THE SHARE OF OA ARTICLES IS STEADILY INCREASING, FROM 31\% IN 2015 TO 52\% IN 2019. GOLD IS THE MOST IMPORTANT VARIANT OF OA. OPEN ACCESS IS LOW IN THE APPLIED RESEARCH AREAS OF CHEMICAL, AGRICULTURAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING BUT HIGHER IN THE DOMAINS OF ENERGY AND FUELS, FORESTRY AND GREEN AND SUSTAINABLE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY. THE UK AND THE NETHERLANDS HAVE THE HIGHEST RATES OF OA ARTICLES, FOLLOWED BY SPAIN AND GERMANY. THE FUNDING RATE OF OA ARTICLES IS HIGHER THAN OF NON-OA ARTICLES. THIS IS THE FIRST BIBLIOMETRIC STUDY ON OPEN ACCESS TO ARTICLES ON BIOECONOMY. THE RESULTS CAN BE USEFUL FOR THE FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF OA EDITORIAL AND FUNDING CRITERIA IN THE FIELD OF BIOECONOMY.",EUROPE; RISE,10.3390/publications8040055,0,include,17,,include,24,,0,include

WE EVALUATED THE CHARACTERISTICS OF PROMINENT CLINICAL DATA SHARING PLATFORMS, INCLUDING TYPES OF STUDIES LISTED AS AVAILABLE FOR REQUEST, DATA REQUESTS RECEIVED, AND RATES OF DISSEMINATION OF RESEARCH FINDINGS FROM DATA REQUESTS. METHODS: WE REVIEWED PUBLICLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION LISTED ON THE WEBSITES OF SIX PROMINENT CLINICAL DATA SHARING PLATFORMS: BIOLOGICAL SPECIMEN AND DATA REPOSITORY INFORMATION COORDINATING CENTER, CLINICALSTUDYDATAREQUEST.COM, PROJECT DATA SPHERE, SUPPORTING OPEN ACCESS TO RESEARCHERS-BRISTOL MYERS SQUIBB, VIVLI, AND THE YALE OPEN DATA ACCESS PROJECT. WE RECORDED KEY PLATFORM CHARACTERISTICS, INCLUDING LISTED STUDIES AND AVAILABLE SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION, INFORMATION ON THE NUMBER AND STATUS OF DATA REQUESTS, AND RATES OF DISSEMINATION OF RESEARCH FINDINGS FROM DATA REQUESTS (I.E.

ALL STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED IN REGULATORY ERA (E.G., GOVERNMENTAL REGULATORY AUTHORITIES, PRIVATE SECTOR, ACADEMIA, AND NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS), AS WELL AS PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE SOCIETY OF ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY, CAN PLAY A KEY ROLE IN SUPPORTING THE OPEN SCIENCE INITIATIVE, BY PROMOTING THE USE OF RECOMMENDED REPORTING CRITERIA FOR RELIABILITY AND RELEVANCE OF DATA AND TOOLS USED IN ERA, AND BY DEVELOPING A COMMUNICATION STRATEGY FOR BOTH PROFESSIONALS AND NONPROFESSIONALS TO TRANSPARENTLY EXPLAIN THE SOCIOECONOMIC VALUE JUDGMENTS AND SCIENTIFIC PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING REGULATORY ERA.

471,N,BIOSECURITY IN AN AGE OF OPEN SCIENCE,"","THE RISK OF ACCIDENTAL OR DELIBERATE MISUSE OF BIOLOGICAL RESEARCH IS INCREASING AS BIOTECHNOLOGY ADVANCES. AS OPEN SCIENCE BECOMES WIDESPREAD, WE MUST CONSIDER ITS IMPACT ON THOSE RISKS AND DEVELOP SOLUTIONS THAT ENSURE SECURITY WHILE FACILITATING SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS. HERE, WE EXAMINE THE INTERACTION BETWEEN OPEN SCIENCE PRACTICES AND BIOSECURITY AND BIOSAFETY TO IDENTIFY RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR RISK MITIGATION. INCREASING THE AVAILABILITY OF COMPUTATIONAL TOOLS, DATASETS, AND PROTOCOLS COULD INCREASE RISKS FROM RESEARCH WITH MISUSE POTENTIAL. FOR INSTANCE, IN THE CONTEXT OF VIRAL ENGINEERING, OPEN CODE, DATA, AND MATERIALS MAY INCREASE THE RISK OF RELEASE OF ENHANCED PATHOGENS. FOR THIS DANGEROUS SUBSET OF RESEARCH, BOTH OPEN SCIENCE AND BIOSECURITY GOALS MAY BE ACHIEVED BY USING ACCESS-CONTROLLED REPOSITORIES OR APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACES. WHILE PREPRINTS ACCELERATE DISSEMINATION OF FINDINGS, THEIR INCREASED USE COULD CHALLENGE STRATEGIES FOR RISK MITIGATION AT THE PUBLICATION STAGE. THIS HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANCE OF OVERSIGHT EARLIER IN THE RESEARCH LIFECYCLE. PREREGISTRATION OF RESEARCH, A PRACTICE PROMOTED BY THE OPEN SCIENCE COMMUNITY, PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ACHIEVING BIOSECURITY RISK ASSESSMENT AT THE CONCEPTION OF RESEARCH.

TO ENSURE THE CREDIBILITY OF GERONTOLOGY RESEARCH MOVING FORWARD, WE SUGGEST CONCRETE WAYS TO INCORPORATE OPEN SCIENCE INTO GERONTOLOGY RESEARCH: FOR EXAMPLE, BY USING AVAILABLE PREREGISTRATION TEMPLATES ADAPTABLE TO A VARIETY OF STUDY DESIGNS TYPICAL FOR AGING RESEARCH (EVEN SECONDARY ANALYSES OF EXISTING DATA).

LACK OF TRANSPARENCY IS COMMON IN SCIENCE, AND IS ENCOURAGED BY JOURNALS THAT PLACE MORE EMPHASIS ON THE AESTHETIC APPEAL OF A MANUSCRIPT THAN THE ROBUSTNESS OF ITS SCIENTIFIC CLAIMS. IN DOING THIS, JOURNALS ARE IMPLICITLY ENCOURAGING AUTHORS TO DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO OBTAIN EYE-CATCHING RESULTS. TO ACHIEVE THIS, RESEARCHERS CAN USE COMMON RESEARCH PRACTICES THAT BEAUTIFY RESULTS AT THE EXPENSE OF THE ROBUSTNESS OF THOSE RESULTS (E.G., P-HACKING). THE PROBLEM IS NOT ENGAGING IN THESE PRACTICES, BUT FAILING TO DISCLOSE THEM. A CAR WHOSE CARBURETOR IS DUCT-TAPED TO THE REST OF THE CAR MIGHT WORK PERFECTLY FINE, BUT THE BUYER HAS A RIGHT TO KNOW ABOUT THE DUCT-TAPING. WITHOUT HIGH LEVELS OF TRANSPARENCY IN SCIENTIFIC PUBLICATIONS, CONSUMERS OF SCIENTIFIC MANUSCRIPTS ARE IN A SIMILAR POSITION AS BUYERS OF USED CARS - THEY CANNOT RELIABLY TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LEMONS AND HIGH QUALITY FINDINGS. THIS PHENOMENON - QUALITY UNCERTAINTY - HAS BEEN SHOWN TO ERODE TRUST IN ECONOMIC MARKETS, SUCH AS THE USED CAR MARKET. THE SAME PROBLEM THREATENS TO ERODE TRUST IN SCIENCE.

546,N,MAKING OPEN SCIENCE WORK FOR SCIENCE AND SOCIETY,"","BACKGROUND: THE OPEN SCIENCE MOVEMENT IS TRANSFORMING SCIENTIFIC PRACTICE WITH THE GOAL OF ENHANCING THE TRANSPARENCY, PRODUCTIVITY, AND REPRODUCIBILITY OF RESEARCH. NEVERTHELESS, TRANSPARENCY IS A COMPLEX CONCEPT. AND EFFORTS TO PROMOTE SOME FORMS OF TRANSPARENCY MAY DO RELATIVELY LITTLE TO ADVANCE OTHER IMPORTANT FORMS OF TRANSPARENCY. OBJECTIVES: DRAWING FROM THE LITERATURE IN HISTORY, PHILOSOPHY, AND SOCIOLOGY OF SCIENCE, WE AIM TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN DIFFERENT FORMS OF SCIENTIFIC TRANSPARENCY. OUR GOAL IS TO IDENTIFY STRATEGIES FOR ACHIEVING FORMS OF TRANSPARENCY THAT ARE RELEVANT NOT ONLY TO SCIENTISTS BUT ALSO TO DECISION MAKERS AND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. DISCUSSION: WE DRAW A DISTINCTION BETWEEN ``SCIENTIFICALLY RELEVANT TRANSPARENCY'' AND ``SOCIALLY RELEVANT TRANSPARENCY.'' MOST OF THE PROMINENT STRATEGIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE OPEN SCIENCE MOVEMENT (E.G., MAKING DATA PUBLICLY AVAILABLE AND REGISTERING STUDIES) ARE DESIGNED PRIMARILY TO PROMOTE SCIENTIFICALLY RELEVANT TRANSPARENCY. TO ACHIEVE SOCIALLY RELEVANT TRANSPARENCY, WHICH IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IN FIELDS LIKE ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH, FURTHER STEPS ARE NEEDED TO PROVIDE SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION IN WAYS THAT ARE RELEVANT TO DECISION MAKERS AND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. CONCLUSIONS: PROMOTING SOCIALLY RELEVANT TRANSPARENCY WILL REQUIRE A RANGE OF ACTIVITIES BY MANY DIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS AND INSTITUTIONS.

COMPUTATIONAL FLUENCY DESCRIBES THE ABILITY OF PRACTITIONERS AND SCIENTISTS TO CONDUCT RESEARCH AND REPRESENT NATURAL SYSTEMS WITHIN THE COMPUTER'S ENVIRONMENT. ADVANCEMENT IN INFORMATION SYNTHESIS FOR NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT REQUIRES MORE SOPHISTICATED COMPUTATIONAL APPROACHES, AS WELL AS REPRODUCIBLE, REUSABLE, EXTENSIBLE, AND TRANSFERABLE METHODS. DESPITE THIS IMPORTANCE, MANY NEW AND CURRENT NATURAL RESOURCE PRACTITIONERS LACK COMPUTATIONAL FLUENCY AND NO COMMON SET OF RECOMMENDED RESOURCES AND PRACTICES EXIST FOR LEARNING THESE SKILLS. BROADLY, ATTAINING COMPUTATIONAL FLUENCY ENTAILS MOVING BEYOND THE SIMPLE USE OF COMPUTERS TO APPLYING SOUND COMPUTATIONAL PRINCIPLES AND METHODS AND INCLUDING COMPUTATIONAL EXPERTS (SUCH AS COMPUTER SCIENTISTS) ON RESEARCH TEAMS. OUR PATH FOR COMPUTATIONAL FLUENCY INCLUDES USING OPEN-SOURCE TOOLS WHEN POSSIBLE; REPRODUCIBLE DATA MANAGEMENT, STATISTICS, AND MODELING; UNDERSTANDING AND APPLYING THE BENEFITS OF BASIC COMPUTER PROGRAMMING TO CARRY OUT MORE COMPLEX PROCEDURES; TRACKING CODE WITH VERSION CONTROL; WORKING IN CONTROLLED COMPUTER ENVIRONMENTS; AND USING ADVANCED COMPUTING RESOURCES. CONSIDERATIONS FOR RESOURCE MANAGERS NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT INCREASINGLY USES COMPUTER-GENERATED RESULTS TO INFORM AND GUIDE DECISION MAKING. OPEN SCIENCE REQUIRES THAT THESE DATA AND SOFTWARE BE REPRODUCIBLE. IN TURN, OPEN SCIENCE PROMOTES COMPUTATIONAL FLUENCY AMONG NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGERS, RESEARCHERS, AND EDUCATORS. BASED UPON OUR EXPERIENCES AND PERSPECTIVES WORKING TO SUPPORT NATURAL RESOURCE PROFESSIONALS, MANY NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGERS WOULD LIKE TO ATTAIN COMPUTATIONALLY FLUENCY, YET LACK FORMAL TRAINING.

KNOWLEDGE OF HOW TO USE TOOLS TO MANIPULATE RESEARCH DATA, AND THE AVAILABILITY OF E-INFRASTRUCTURES TO SUPPORT THEM FOR DATA STORAGE, PROCESSING, ANALYSIS AND PRESERVATION, IS FUNDAMENTAL. IN PARALLEL, NEW TYPES OF COMMUNITIES ARE FORMING AROUND INTERESTS IN DIGITAL TOOLS, COMPUTING FACILITIES AND DATA REPOSITORIES. BY MAKING INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICES, COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND TRAINING INSEPARABLE, EXISTING COMMUNITIES CAN BE EMPOWERED BY NEW WAYS OF DOING RESEARCH, AND NEW COMMUNITIES CAN BE CREATED AROUND TOOLS AND DATA. EUROPE IS IDEALLY POSITIONED TO BECOME A WORLD LEADER AS PROVIDER OF RESEARCH DATA FOR THE BENEFIT OF RESEARCH COMMUNITIES AND THE WIDER ECONOMY AND SOCIETY. EUROPE WOULD BENEFIT FROM AN INTEGRATED INFRASTRUCTURE WHERE DATA AND COMPUTING SERVICES FOR BIG DATA CAN BE EASILY SHARED AND REUSED. THIS IS PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING IN EO GIVEN THE VOLUMES AND VARIETY OF THE DATA THAT MAKE SCALABLE ACCESS DIFFICULT, IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE, TO INDIVIDUAL RESEARCHERS AND SMALL GROUPS (I.E. TO THE SO-CALLED LONG TAIL OF SCIENCE). TO OVERCOME THIS LIMITATION, AS PART OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION DIGITAL SINGLE MARKET STRATEGY, THE EUROPEAN OPEN SCIENCE CLOUD (EOSC) INITIATIVE WAS LAUNCHED IN APRIL 2016, WITH THE FINAL AIM TO REALISE THE EUROPEAN RESEARCH AREA (ERA) AND RAISE RESEARCH TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

THIS IS SPECIFICALLY RELEVANT IN THE EMERGENCY MEDICINE FIELD DUE TO THE IMPORTANCE OF PROVIDING IMMEDIATE CARE IN CRITICAL SITUATIONS AS THE VERY CURRENT CORONAVIRUS (COVID-19) PANDEMIC IS SHOWING TO THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY. THIS WORK AIMS TO SHOW WHICH EMERGENCY MEDICINE JOURNALS INDEXED IN JOURNAL CITATION REPORTS (JCR) CURRENTLY MEET DATA SHARING CRITERIA. (2) METHODS: THIS STUDY ANALYZES THE EDITORIAL POLICIES REGARDING THE DATA DEPOSIT OF THE JOURNALS IN THE EMERGENCY MEDICINE CATEGORY OF THE JCR AND EVALUATES THE SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL OF THE ARTICLES PUBLISHED IN THESE JOURNALS THAT HAVE BEEN DEPOSITED IN THE PUBMED CENTRAL REPOSITORY. (3) RESULTS: IT HAS BEEN OBSERVED THAT 19 OUT OF THE 24 JOURNALS CONTAINED IN THE EMERGENCY MEDICINE CATEGORY OF JOURNAL CITATION REPORTS ARE ALSO LOCATED IN PUBMED CENTRAL (PMC), YIELDING A TOTAL OF 5983 ARTICLES. OUT OF THESE, ONLY 9.4\% OF THE ARTICLES CONTAIN SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL. ALTHOUGH SECOND QUARTILE JOURNALS OF JCR EMERGENCY MEDICINE CATEGORY HAVE QUANTITATIVELY MORE ARTICLES IN PMC, THE MAIN JOURNALS INVOLVED IN THE DEPOSIT OF SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL BELONG TO THE FIRST QUARTILE, OF WHICH THE MOST USED FORMAT IN THE ARTICLES IS PDF, FOLLOWED BY TEXT DOCUMENTS. (4) CONCLUSION: THIS STUDY REVEALS THAT DATA SHARING REMAINS AN INCIPIENT PRACTICE IN THE EMERGENCY MEDICINE FIELD, AS THERE ARE STILL BARRIERS BETWEEN RESEARCHERS TO PARTICIPATE IN DATA SHARING. THEREFORE, IT IS NECESSARY TO PROMOTE DYNAMICS TO IMPROVE THIS PRACTICE BOTH QUALITATIVELY (THE QUALITY AND FORMAT OF DATASETS) AND QUANTITATIVELY (THE QUANTITY OF DATASETS IN ABSOLUTE TERMS) IN RESEARCH.","",10.3390/data5020028,0,include,17,,include,24,,0,include

THIS STUDY PROVIDES STANDARD ESTIMATES OF INFANTS' (N = 194, AGES 9 TO 15 MONTHS) SACCADIC RTS UNDER A RANGE OF DIFFERENT SPATIOTEMPORAL CONDITIONS. TO INVESTIGATE THE RELIABILITY OF SUCH STANDARD ESTIMATES, DATA IS COLLECTED AT 4 LABORATORIES IN 3 COUNTRIES. RESULTS INDICATE THAT REACTIONS TO THE APPEARANCE OF A NEW OBJECT ARE MUCH FASTER THAN REACTIONS TO THE DEFLECTION OF A CURRENTLY FIXATED MOVING OBJECT; UPWARD SACCADES ARE SLOWER THAN DOWNWARD OR HORIZONTAL SACCADES; REACTIONS TO MORE PERIPHERAL STIMULI ARE MUCH SLOWER; AND THIS SLOWDOWN IS GREATER FOR BOYS THAN GIRLS. THERE WAS LITTLE DECREASE IN SACCADIC RTS BETWEEN 9 AND 15 MONTHS, INDICATING THAT THE PERIOD OF SLOW DEVELOPMENT WHICH IS PROTRACTED INTO ADOLESCENCE BEGINS IN LATE INFANCY.

IN TWO-DIMENSIONAL (2D) AND THREE-DIMENSIONAL (3D) SPACE IN COMMON WEB BROWSERS, SUCH AS GOOGLE CHROME, MOZILLA FIREFOX, SAFARI, OR MICROSOFT EDGE. OTHER FUNCTIONALITIES ARE THE CALCULATION OF MEDICAL METRICS (DICE SCORE AND HAUSDORFF DISTANCE), MANUAL SLICE-BY-SLICE OUTLINING OF STRUCTURES IN MEDICAL IMAGES, MANUAL PLACING OF (ANATOMICAL) LANDMARKS IN MEDICAL IMAGING DATA, VISUALIZATION OF MEDICAL DATA IN VIRTUAL REALITY (VR), AND A FACIAL RECONSTRUCTION AND REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL DATA FOR AUGMENTED REALITY (AR).

THIS PAPER PROPOSES A QGIS PLUGIN THAT DETERMINES MST ON GEOGRAPHICAL DATA USING KRUSKAL'S ALGORITHM. THE UPDATED VERSION OF THE PLUGIN (V2.0) OFFERS THREE SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENTS WITH RESPECT TO ITS FORMER VERSION (V1.0). FIRST, THE UPDATED VERSION IS MUCH FASTER IN EXECUTION.

THIS PAPER DESCRIBES A NOVEL APPROACH TO TEACHING DATA ETHICS ON SHORT COURSES DEVELOPED FOR THE CODATA-RDA SCHOOLS FOR RESEARCH DATA SCIENCE. THE ETHICS CONTENT OF THESE SCHOOLS IS CENTRED ON THE CONCEPT OF OPEN AND RESPONSIBLE (DATA) SCIENCE CITIZENSHIP THAT DRAWS ON VIRTUE ETHICS TO PROMOTE ETHICS OF PRACTICE. DESPITE HAVING LITTLE FORMAL TEACHING TIME, THIS CONCEPT OF CITIZENSHIP IS MADE CENTRAL TO THE COURSE BY DISTRIBUTING ETHICS CONTENT ACROSS TECHNICAL MODULES. ETHICS INSTRUCTION CONSISTS OF A WIDE RANGE OF TECHNIQUES, INCLUDING STAND-ALONE LECTURES, GROUP DISCUSSIONS AND MINI-EXERCISES LINKED TO TECHNICAL MODULES. THIS MULTI-LEVEL APPROACH ENABLES STUDENTS TO DEVELOP AN UNDERSTANDING BOTH OF ``RESPONSIBLE AND OPEN (DATA) SCIENCE CITIZENSHIP'' AND OF HOW SUCH RESPONSIBILITIES ARE IMPLEMENTED IN DAILY RESEARCH PRACTICES WITHIN THEIR HOME ENVIRONMENT. THIS APPROACH SUCCESSFULLY LOCATES ETHICS WITHIN DAILY DATA SCIENCE PRACTICE, AND ALLOWS STUDENTS TO SEE HOW SMALL ACTIONS BUILD INTO LARGER ETHICAL CONCERNS.

THEY ARE USUALLY VALIDATED IN MORE DETAIL IN SEPARATE PSYCHOMETRIC STUDIES OR VERY CURSORILY IN SUBSTANTIVE STUDIES. HOWEVER, METHODOLOGISTS ADVISE THAT, AS VALIDITY IS A PROPERTY OF THE INFERENCES BASED ON MEASUREMENT IN A CONTEXT, PSYCHOMETRIC ANALYSES SHOULD BE PERFORMED IN SUBSTANTIVE STUDIES AS WELL. UNTIL RECENTLY, PERFORMING COMPREHENSIVE PSYCHOMETRICS REQUIRED EXPERT KNOWLEDGE OF DIFFERENT, OFTEN PROPRIETARY, SOFTWARE. THE INCREASING AVAILABILITY OF STATISTICAL TECHNIQUES IN THE R ENVIRONMENT NOW MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO INTEGRATE SUCH ANALYSES IN APPLIED RESEARCH. METHODS: IN THIS TUTORIAL, I INTRODUCE A 6-STEP PROTOCOL WHICH ALLOWS DETAILED DIAGNOSIS OF CORE PSYCHOMETRIC PROPERTIES (E.G. STRUCTURAL VALIDITY, INTERNAL CONSISTENCY) FOR SCALES WITH BINARY AND ORDINAL RESPONSE OPTIONS AIMING TO MEASURE DIFFERENCES IN DEGREE OR QUANTITY, THE MOST COMMON IN APPLIED RESEARCH. THE PROTOCOL INCLUDES INVESTIGATIONS OF (1) ITEM DISTRIBUTIONS AND SUMMARY STATISTICS, ITEM PROPERTIES VIA (2) NON-PARAMETRIC AND (3) PARAMETRIC ITEM RESPONSE THEORY, (4) SCALE STRUCTURE USING FACTOR ANALYSIS, (5) RELIABILITY VIA CLASSICAL TEST THEORY, AND (6) CALCULATION AND DESCRIPTION OF GLOBAL SCORES. I ILLUSTRATE THE PROCEDURE ON A MEASURE OF SELF-REPORTED DISABILITY, THE 24-ITEM SICKNESS IMPACT PROFILE ROLAND SCALE (RM-SIP), ADMINISTERED IN A SURVEY OF 222 CHRONIC PAIN SUFFERERS. AN R MARKDOWN SCRIPT IS PROVIDED THAT GENERATES REPRODUCIBLE REPORTS. RESULTS: IN THIS SAMPLE, 15 OF 24 RM-SIP ITEMS FORMED A UNIDIMENSIONAL ORDINAL SCALE WITH GOOD HOMOGENEITY (H = 0.43) AND RELIABILITY (ALPHA = .86[.84-.89]; OMEGA = .87[.85-.88]). THE TWO VERSIONS WERE HIGHLY CORRELATED (R = .96), AND REGRESSION MODELS PREDICTING RM-SIP DISABILITY PRODUCED COMPARABLE RESULTS.

WHEN CAUSED BY A NEW VIRUS, UNDERSTANDING THE UNDERLYING BIOLOGY MAY HELP FINDING SOLUTIONS. IN A SETTING WHERE THERE ARE A LARGE NUMBER OF LOOSELY RELATED PROJECTS AND INITIATIVES, WE NEED COMMON GROUND, ALSO KNOWN AS A ``COMMONS.'' WIKIDATA, A PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE GRAPH ALIGNED WITH WIKIPEDIA, IS SUCH A COMMONS AND USES UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS TO LINK KNOWLEDGE IN OTHER KNOWLEDGE BASES. HOWEVER, WIKIDATA MAY NOT ALWAYS HAVE THE RIGHT SCHEMA FOR THE URGENT QUESTIONS. IN THIS PAPER, WE ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM BY SHOWING HOW A DATA SCHEMA REQUIRED FOR THE INTEGRATION CAN BE MODELED WITH ENTITY SCHEMAS REPRESENTED BY SHAPE EXPRESSIONS. RESULTS: AS A TELLING EXAMPLE, WE DESCRIBE THE PROCESS OF ALIGNING RESOURCES ON THE GENOMES AND PROTEOMES OF THE SARS-COV-2 VIRUS AND RELATED VIRUSES AS WELL AS HOW SHAPE EXPRESSIONS CAN BE DEFINED FOR WIKIDATA TO MODEL THE KNOWLEDGE, HELPING OTHERS STUDYING THE SARS-COV-2 PANDEMIC. HOW THIS MODEL CAN BE USED TO MAKE DATA BETWEEN VARIOUS RESOURCES INTEROPERABLE IS DEMONSTRATED BY INTEGRATING DATA FROM NCBI (NATIONAL CENTER FOR BIOTECHNOLOGY INFORMATION) TAXONOMY, NCBI GENES, UNIPROT, AND WIKIPATHWAYS.

WE ARGUE THAT ONE OF THE MOST DIVISIVE FACTORS IN PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE IS WHETHER RESEARCHERS CHOOSE TO USE COMPUTATIONAL MODELING OF THEORIES (OVER AND ABOVE DATA) DURING THE SCIENTIFIC-INFERENCE PROCESS. MODELING IS UNDERVALUED YET HOLDS PROMISE FOR ADVANCING PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE. THE INHERENT DEMANDS OF COMPUTATIONAL MODELING GUIDE US TOWARD BETTER SCIENCE BY FORCING US TO CONCEPTUALLY ANALYZE, SPECIFY, AND FORMALIZE INTUITIONS THAT OTHERWISE REMAIN UNEXAMINED-WHAT WE DUB OPEN THEORY. CONSTRAINING OUR INFERENCE PROCESS THROUGH MODELING ENABLES US TO BUILD EXPLANATORY AND PREDICTIVE THEORIES. HERE, WE PRESENT SCIENTIFIC INFERENCE IN PSYCHOLOGY AS A PATH FUNCTION IN WHICH EACH STEP SHAPES THE NEXT. COMPUTATIONAL MODELING CAN CONSTRAIN THESE STEPS, THUS ADVANCING SCIENTIFIC INFERENCE OVER AND ABOVE THE STEWARDSHIP OF EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE (E.G., PREREGISTRATION). IF PSYCHOLOGY CONTINUES TO ESCHEW COMPUTATIONAL MODELING, WE PREDICT MORE REPLICABILITY CRISES AND PERSISTENT FAILURE AT COHERENT THEORY BUILDING. THIS IS BECAUSE WITHOUT FORMAL MODELING WE LACK OPEN AND TRANSPARENT THEORIZING. WE ALSO EXPLAIN HOW TO FORMALIZE, SPECIFY, AND IMPLEMENT A COMPUTATIONAL MODEL, EMPHASIZING THAT THE ADVANTAGES OF MODELING CAN BE ACHIEVED BY ANYONE WITH BENEFIT TO ALL.","",10.1177/1745691620970585,0,include,17,,include,24,,0,include

THE CONCLUSION IS THAT AN EXCITED FORM OF MATTER, WITH A VERY LOW WORK FUNCTION, IS LOCATED ON THE COLLECTOR SURFACE AND IN THE INTERELECTRODE SPACE. THE MATTER CONSISTS OF HIGHLY EXCITED CESIUM ATOMS IN A CONDENSED FORM, AND IS REFERRED TO AS RYDBERG MATTER (RM). THE EXISTENCE OF RM HAS BEEN PREDICTED THEORETICALLY BY MANYKIN, ET AL. [4]. THE EFFICIENCY OF THE RM TEC VARIES CONSIDERABLY WITH PARAMETERS SUCH AS EMITTER TEMPERATURE AND COLLECTOR TEMPERATURE. THERE IS ALSO A DISCREPANCY BETWEEN THE APPARENT COLLECTOR WORK FUNCTION WHEN THE COLLECTOR IS RUN AS ELECTRON EMITTER AND WHEN IT IS USED AS AN ELECTRON COLLECTOR. FROM OTHER EXPERIMENTS WE CONCLUDE THAT NEGATIVE IONS CS-. WILL FORM ON THE RM SURFACE ON THE COLLECTOR [5]. IN ORDER TO CONTROL THE EFFECT OF POSSIBLE NEGATIVE IONS, A SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS INCLUDING RAPID PULSING OF THE TEC IS IN PROGRESS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PULSING IS TO USE A NEGATIVE PULSE (WITH RESPECT TO THE COLLECTOR) TO REMOVE POSSIBLE NEGATIVE IONS FROM THE RM SURFACE AND RESTORE THE LOW WORK FUNCTION OF THE RM SURFACE.","",10.1109/IECEC.1997.661918,0,exclude,17,,exclude,24,,0,exclude

WE HERE REPORT SUMMARIES OF THE PRESENTATIONS AND DISCUSSIONS AT THE MEETING. THEY DEAL WITH FOUR SETS OF ISSUES: (I) SETTING A COMMON FRAMEWORK, A GENERAL DISCUSSION OF OPEN DATA PRINCIPLES, VALUES AND OPPORTUNITIES; (II) INSIGHTS INTO SCIENTIFIC PRACTICES, A VIEW OF THE WAY IN WHICH THE OPEN DATA MOVEMENT IS DEVELOPING IN A VARIETY OF SCIENTIFIC DOMAINS (BIOLOGY, PSYCHOLOGY, EPIDEMIOLOGY AND ARCHAEOLOGY); (III) A CASE STUDY OF HUMAN GENOMICS, WHICH WAS A TRAIL-BLAZER IN DATA SHARING, AND WHICH ENCAPSULATES THE TENSION THAT CAN OCCUR BETWEEN LARGE-SCALE DATA SHARING AND ONE OF THE BOUNDARIES OF OPENNESS, THE PROTECTION OF INDIVIDUAL DATA; (IV) OPEN SCIENCE AND THE PUBLIC, BASED ON A ROUND TABLE DISCUSSION ABOUT THE PUBLIC COMMUNICATION OF SCIENCE AND THE SOCIETAL IMPLICATIONS OF OPEN SCIENCE. THERE WERE THREE PROPOSALS FOR THE PLANNING OF FURTHER INTERDISCIPLINARY INITIATIVES ON OPEN SCIENCE. FIRSTLY, THERE IS A NEED TO INTEGRATE TOP-DOWN INITIATIVES BY GOVERNMENTS, INSTITUTIONS AND JOURNALS WITH BOTTOM-UP APPROACHES FROM THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY. SECONDLY, MORE SHOULD BE DONE TO POPULARIZE THE SOCIETAL BENEFITS OF OPEN SCIENCE, NOT ONLY IN PROVIDING THE EVIDENCE NEEDED BY CITIZENS TO DRAW THEIR OWN CONCLUSIONS ON SCIENTIFIC ISSUES THAT ARE OF CONCERN TO THEM, BUT ALSO EXPLAINING THE DIRECT BENEFITS OF DATA SHARING IN AREAS SUCH AS THE CONTROL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE.

DESPITE ITS SUBSTANTIAL BURDEN ON SOCIETY, THE RESEARCH ACTIVITY IN BD IS MUCH SMALLER THAN ITS ECONOMIC IMPACT APPEARS TO DEMAND. THERE IS A CONSENSUS THAT THE ACCURATE IDENTIFICATION OF THE UNDERLYING PATHOPHYSIOLOGY FOR BD IS FUNDAMENTAL TO REALIZE MAJOR HEALTH BENEFITS THROUGH BETTER TREATMENT AND PREVENTIVE REGIMENS. HOWEVER, TO ACHIEVE THESE GOALS REQUIRES COORDINATED ACTION AND INNOVATIVE APPROACHES TO BOOST THE DISCOVERY OF THE NEUROBIOLOGICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF BD, AND RAPID TRANSLATION OF RESEARCH FINDINGS INTO DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING OF BETTER AND MORE SPECIFIC TREATMENTS. TO THIS END, WE HERE PROPOSE THAT ONLY A LARGE-SCALE COORDINATED ACTION CAN BE SUCCESSFUL IN INTEGRATING INTERNATIONAL BIG-DATA APPROACHES WITH REAL-WORLD CLINICAL INTERVENTIONS. THIS COULD BE ACHIEVED THROUGH THE CREATION OF A GLOBAL BIPOLAR DISORDER FOUNDATION, WHICH COULD BRING GOVERNMENT, INDUSTRY AND PHILANTHROPY TOGETHER IN COMMON CAUSE. A GLOBAL INITIATIVE FOR BD RESEARCH WOULD COME AT A HIGHLY OPPORTUNE TIME GIVEN THE SEMINAL ADVANCES PROMISED FOR OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE GENETIC AND BRAIN BASIS OF THE DISEASE AND THE OBVIOUS AREAS OF UNMET CLINICAL NEED. SUCH AN ENDEAVOUR WOULD EMBRACE THE PRINCIPLES OF OPEN SCIENCE AND SEE THE STRONG INVOLVEMENT OF USER GROUPS AND INTEGRATION OF DISSEMINATION AND PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT WITH THE RESEARCH PROGRAMS.

EXPERIMENTS 1 A THROUGH IC ASK PARTICIPANTS TO LIST THE CHOICE ITEMS THAT COME TO THEIR MINDS WHILE DELIBERATING IN A VARIETY OF EVERYDAY CHOICE SETTINGS. THESE EXPERIMENTS USE SEMANTIC SPACE MODELS TO QUANTIFY THE SEMANTIC RELATEDNESS BETWEEN PAIRS OF RETRIEVED ITEMS AND FIND THAT CHOICE ITEM RETRIEVAL DISPLAYS ROBUST SEMANTIC CLUSTERING EFFECTS, WITH RETRIEVED ITEMS INCREASING THE RETRIEVAL PROBABILITIES OF RELATED ITEMS. SEMANTIC CLUSTERING CAN BE DISASSOCIATED FROM THE EFFECT OF ITEM DESIRABILITY AND CAN LEAD TO INEFFICIENCIES SUCH AS THE CONSIDERATION AND EVALUATION OF UNDESIRABLE ITEMS EARLY ON IN THE DECISION. EXPERIMENTS 2A THROUGH 2C USE A SIMILAR APPROACH TO STUDY THE EFFECTS OF CONTEXTUAL CUES ON ITEM RETRIEVAL AND FIND THAT DECISION MAKERS ARE BIASED TOWARD RETRIEVING CHOICE ITEMS THAT ARE SEMANTICALLY RELATED TO THE CHOICE CONTEXT. THIS EFFECT IS USUALLY STRONGEST EARLY ON IN DELIBERATION AND WEAKENS AS ADDITIONAL ITEMS ARE RETRIEVED. OVERALL, THE RESULTS HIGHLIGHT THE ROLE OF SEMANTIC MEMORY PROCESSES IN GUIDING THE GENERATION OF MEMORY-BASED CHOICE SETS.

IN CONTRAST TO LABORATORY-BASED STUDIES, EMA INVOLVES THE REPEATED SAMPLING OF EXPERIENCES IN DAILY LIFE CONTEXTS, ENABLING INVESTIGATORS TO GAIN ACCESS TO DYNAMIC PROCESSES (E.G., SITUATIONAL CONTEXTS, INTRAINDIVIDUAL VARIABILITY) THAT ARE LIKELY TO STRONGLY CONTRIBUTE TO AGING AND AGE-RELATED CHANGE ACROSS THE ADULT LIFE-SPAN. AS SUCH, EMA APPROACHES COMPLEMENT THE PREVAILING RESEARCH METHODS IN THE FIELD OF COGNITIVE AGING (E.G., LABORATORY-BASED PARADIGMS, NEUROIMAGING), WHILE ALSO PROVIDING THE OPPORTUNITY TO REPLICATE AND EXTEND FINDINGS FROM THE LABORATORY IN MORE NATURALISTIC CONTEXTS. FOLLOWING AN OVERVIEW OF THE METHODOLOGICAL AND CONCEPTUAL STRENGTHS OF EMA APPROACHES IN COGNITIVE AGING RESEARCH, WE DISCUSS BEST PRACTICES FOR RESEARCHERS INTERESTED IN IMPLEMENTING EMA STUDIES. A KEY GOAL IS TO HIGHLIGHT THE TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL FOR COMBINING EMA METHODS WITH OTHER LABORATORY-BASED APPROACHES, IN ORDER TO INCREASE THE ROBUSTNESS, REPLICABILITY, AND REAL-WORLD IMPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH FINDINGS IN THE FIELD OF COGNITIVE AGING.",WORKING-MEMORY PERFORMANCE; AGE-RELATED DIFFERENCES; MULTIPLE; TIME-SCALES; AMBULATORY ASSESSMENT; INTRAINDIVIDUAL VARIABILITY; ADULT; DEVELOPMENT; BETWEEN-PERSON; MISSING DATA; MIND; VALIDITY,10.1037/pag0000646,0,exclude,17,,exclude,24,,0,exclude

THIS PAPER IDENTIFIES METHODOLOGICAL SHORTCOMINGS WITHIN THIS BROAD DOMAIN OF RESEARCH AND EXEMPLIFIES THEM IN STUDIES FOCUSED SPECIFICALLY ON ALCOHOL-RELATED ATTENTIONAL BIAS. ARGUMENT AND ANALYSIS WE HIGHLIGHT FIVE MAIN METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES: (I) THE USE OF INAPPROPRIATELY MATCHED CONTROL STIMULI; (II) OPACITY OF STIMULUS SELECTION AND VALIDATION PROCEDURES; (III) A CREDENCE IN NOISY MEASURES; (IV) A RELIANCE ON UNRELIABLE TASKS; AND (V) VARIABILITY IN DESIGN AND ANALYSIS. THIS IS EVIDENCED THROUGH A REVIEW OF ALCOHOL-RELATED ATTENTIONAL BIAS (64 EMPIRICAL ARTICLES, 68 TASKS), WHICH REVEALS THE FOLLOWING: ONLY 53\% OF TASKS USE APPROPRIATELY MATCHED CONTROL STIMULI; AS FEW AS 38\% REPORT THEIR STIMULUS SELECTION AND 19\% THEIR VALIDATION PROCEDURES; LESS THAN 28\% USED INDICES CAPABLE OF DISAMBIGUATING ATTENTIONAL PROCESSES; 22\% ASSESS RELIABILITY; AND UNDER 2\% OF STUDIES WERE PRE-REGISTERED. CONCLUSIONS WELL-MATCHED AND VALIDATED EXPERIMENTAL STIMULI, THE DEVELOPMENT OF RELIABLE COGNITIVE TASKS AND EXPLICIT ASSESSMENT OF THEIR PSYCHOMETRIC PROPERTIES, AND CAREFUL CONSIDERATION OF BEHAVIOURAL INDICES AND THEIR ANALYSIS WILL IMPROVE THE METHODOLOGICAL RIGOUR OF COGNITIVE ALCOHOL RESEARCH.

AS A REMEDY, I RECOMMEND THE ADOPTION OF MICROPUBLISHING IN THE FIELDS OF SOCIAL AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES. WHILE MICROPUBLISHING HAS BEEN GAINING POPULARITY, IT IS NOT YET WIDELY ACCEPTED OR UTILIZED BY EXISTING ACADEMIC JOURNALS. GREATER IMPLEMENTATION WOULD IMPROVE THE AVAILABILITY OF DATA IN THE IMMEDIATE COVID-19 ERA AND ESTABLISH A POST-COVID-19 PUBLISHING METHODOLOGY THAT COULD INCREASE RESEARCHER AND PRACTITIONER ENGAGEMENT IN REAL TIME. I RECOMMEND MICROPUBLISHING IN A SPECIFIC MANNER THAT BIFURCATES AN EXPERIMENT'S METHODOLOGY OR SURVEY METHOD FROM THE SUBSEQUENTLY PUBLISHED DATA BASED ON THAT EXPERIMENT PROTOCOL. PUBLISHED FINDINGS COULD BE PRESENTED IN A SERIES AND EDITED AS NEW DATA EMERGES. THIS PUBLISHING SYSTEM PROMOTES CUMULATIVE SCIENCE. TO PROVIDE A VISUAL EXAMPLE THAT SUPPORTS MY ARGUMENT, I CREATED A DEMO JOURNAL WITH SAMPLE PAPERS ORGANIZED ACCORDING TO THE STRUCTURE I RECOMMEND. THE DEMO JOURNAL HAS FEATURES-EXCEPT A DIGITAL OBJECT FINDER (DOI)-THAT MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO PUBLISH SOCIAL AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES RESEARCH. IT COULD BE REPLICATED FOR A NEWLY ESTABLISHED JOURNAL.

AS OPEN-ACCESS LARGE DATASETS RESULT FROM THIS SIGNIFICANT INITIATIVE, DATA MINING TECHNIQUES CAN BE CONSIDERED FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTERPRETABLE EXPERT SYSTEMS TO HELP IN DIAGNOSIS. HOWEVER, THE COLLABORATIVE EFFORT OF INFORMATION GATHERING YIELDS HETEROGENEOUS DATABASES BECAUSE OF TECHNICAL AND GEOGRAPHICAL FACTORS. INDEED, ON THE ONE HAND, THE HARMONIZATION OF PROTOCOLS FOR DATA COLLECTION IS STILL MISSING. ON THE OTHER HAND, CULTURAL AND SOCIAL FACTORS IMPACT LOCALLY BOTH THE EPIDEMIOLOGY AND ETIOLOGY OF A GIVEN DISEASE.

IT IS PRIMARILY, ALTHOUGH NOT EXCLUSIVELY, FUNDED BY GOVERNMENT AND NONPROFIT SOURCES. MUCH OF IT IS PRODUCED AT ACADEMIC RESEARCH CENTERS, ALTHOUGH SOME ACADEMIC SCIENCE IS PROPRIETARY AND SOME PRIVATELY FUNDED R\&D ENTERS THE SCIENCE COMMONS. SCIENCE IN GENERAL ASPIRES TO MERTONIAN NORMS OF OPENNESS, UNIVERSALITY, OBJECTIVITY, AND CRITICAL INQUIRY. THE SCIENCE COMMONS DIVERGES FROM PROPRIETARY SCIENCE PRIMARILY IN BEING OPEN AND BEING VERY BROADLY AVAILABLE. THESE FEATURES MAKE THE SCIENCE COMMONS PARTICULARLY VALUABLE FOR ADVANCING KNOWLEDGE, FOR TRAINING INNOVATORS WHO WILL ULTIMATELY WORK IN BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS, AND IN PROVIDING A COMMON STOCK OF KNOWLEDGE UPON WHICH ALL PLAYERS-BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE-CAN DRAW READILY. OPEN SCIENCE PLAYS TWO IMPORTANT ROLES THAT PROPRIETARY R\&D CANNOT: IT ENABLES PRACTICAL BENEFITS EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF PROFITABLE MARKETS FOR GOODS AND SERVICES, AND ITS LAYS A SHARED FOUNDATION FOR SUBSEQUENT PRIVATE R\&D. THE HISTORY OF GENOMICS IN THE PERIOD 1992-2004, COVERING TWO PERIODS WHEN GENOMIC STARTUP FIRMS ATTRACTED SIGNIFICANT PRIVATE R\&D INVESTMENT, ILLUSTRATES THESE FEATURES OF HOW A SCIENCE COMMONS CONTRIBUTES VALUE. COMMERCIAL INTEREST IN GENOMICS WAS INTENSE DURING THIS PERIOD. FIERCE COMPETITION BETWEEN PRIVATE SECTOR AND PUBLIC SECTOR GENOMICS PROGRAMS WAS HIGHLY VISIBLE. SEEMINGLY ANOMALOUS BEHAVIOR, SUCH AS PRIVATE FIRMS FUNDING ``OPEN SCIENCE,'' CAN BE EXPLAINED BY UNUSUAL BUSINESS DYNAMICS BETWEEN ESTABLISHED FIRMS WANTING TO PRESERVE A ROBUST SCIENCE COMMONS TO PREVENT STARTUP FIRMS FROM LIMITING ESTABLISHED FIRMS' FREEDOM TO OPERATE.

WHILE A LACK OF RESEARCH REPRODUCIBILITY HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A SERIOUS AND PREVALENT PROBLEM IN BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH AND A FEW OTHER FIELDS, LITTLE WORK HAS BEEN DONE TO EXAMINE THE REPRODUCIBILITY OF PUBLIC HEALTH RESEARCH. WE EXAMINED REPRODUCIBILITY IN 6 STUDIES FROM THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES AND SYSTEMS RESEARCH SUBFIELD OF PUBLIC HEALTH RESEARCH. DESIGN: FOLLOWING THE METHODS DESCRIBED IN EACH OF THE 6 PAPERS, WE COMPUTED THE DESCRIPTIVE AND INFERENTIAL STATISTICS FOR EACH STUDY. WE COMPARED OUR RESULTS WITH THE ORIGINAL STUDY RESULTS AND EXAMINED THE PERCENTAGE DIFFERENCES IN DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS AND DIFFERENCES IN EFFECT SIZE, SIGNIFICANCE, AND PRECISION OF INFERENTIAL STATISTICS. ALL PROJECT WORK WAS COMPLETED IN 2017. RESULTS: WE FOUND CONSISTENCY BETWEEN ORIGINAL AND REPRODUCED RESULTS FOR EACH PAPER IN AT LEAST 1 OF THE 4 AREAS EXAMINED. HOWEVER, WE ALSO FOUND SOME INCONSISTENCY. WE IDENTIFIED INCORRECT TRANSCRIPTION OF RESULTS AND OMITTING DETAIL ABOUT DATA MANAGEMENT AND ANALYSES AS THE PRIMARY CONTRIBUTORS TO THE INCONSISTENCIES. RECOMMENDATIONS: INCREASING REPRODUCIBILITY, OR REANALYSIS OF DATA TO VERIFY PUBLISHED RESULTS, CAN IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF SCIENCE. RESEARCHERS, JOURNALS, EMPLOYERS, AND FUNDERS CAN ALL PLAY A ROLE IN IMPROVING THE REPRODUCIBILITY OF SCIENCE THROUGH SEVERAL STRATEGIES INCLUDING PUBLISHING DATA AND STATISTICAL CODE, USING GUIDELINES TO WRITE CLEAR AND COMPLETE METHODS SECTIONS, CONDUCTING REPRODUCIBILITY REVIEWS, AND INCENTIVIZING REPRODUCIBLE SCIENCE.","",10.1097/PHH.0000000000000694,0,include,31,,include,20,,0,include

IN THE PRESENT PAPER, I PROPOSE AN ALTERNATIVE SYSTEM FOR CONDUCTING RIGOROUS AND REPLICABLE PSYCHOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS, WHICH I DESCRIBE AS EXPLORING SMALL, CONFIRMING BIG. I BEGIN WITH A CRITICAL EVALUATION OF THE MERITS OF NHST AND SMALL-SCALE META-ANALYSES, AND ARGUE THAT NHST DOES HAVE A VALUABLE ROLE IN THE SCIENTIFIC PROCESS, WHEREAS SMALL-SCALE META-ANALYSES WILL DO LITTLE TO ADVANCE A CUMULATIVE SCIENCE. I THEN PRESENT AN OVERVIEW OF AN ALTERNATIVE SYSTEM FOR PRODUCING CUMULATIVE AND REPLICABLE PSYCHOLOGICAL RESEARCH: EXPLORING SMALL, CONFIRMING BIG. IT INVOLVES A TWO-STEP PROCESS TO PSYCHOLOGICAL RESEARCH, CONSISTING OF (1) SMALL N INVESTIGATION(S), IN WHICH PSYCHOLOGISTS USE NHST TO DEVELOP EXPLORATORY MODELS; AND (2) STRONG, CONFIRMATORY TESTS OF EXPLORATORY MODELS, BY ANALYZING NEW AND/OR EXISTING LARGE N DATASETS WITH VARIABLES THAT CAPTURE THE EFFECT(S) OF INTEREST FROM THE EXPLORING SMALL STAGE. I CONCLUDE BY DISCUSSING SEVERAL ANTICIPATED BENEFITS AND CHALLENGES OF ADOPTING THE EXPLORING SMALL, CONFIRMING BIG APPROACH. (C) 2015 ELSEVIER INC.

WE ASSESS INTERNAL VALIDITY THROUGH COVARIATE BALANCE, CONFIDENCE-INTERVAL COVERAGE, BETWEEN-DATABASE HETEROGENEITY, AND TRANSITIVITY OF RESULTS. WE ASSESS EXTERNAL VALIDITY THROUGH COMPARISON TO DIRECT META-ANALYSES OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS). RESULTS: FROM 21.6 MILLION UNIQUE ANTIHYPERTENSIVE NEW USERS, WE GENERATE 6 076 775 EFFECT SIZE ESTIMATES FOR 699 872 RESEARCH QUESTIONS ON 12 946 TREATMENT COMPARISONS. THROUGH PROPENSITY SCORE MATCHING, WE ACHIEVE BALANCE ON ALL BASELINE PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS FOR 75\% OF ESTIMATES, OBSERVE 95.7\% COVERAGE IN OUR EFFECT-ESTIMATE 95\% CONFIDENCE INTERVALS, FIND HIGH BETWEEN-DATABASE CONSISTENCY, AND ACHIEVE TRANSITIVITY IN 84.8\% OF TRIPLET HYPOTHESES. COMPARED WITH META-ANALYSES OF RCTS, OUR RESULTS ARE CONSISTENT WITH 28 OF 30 COMPARISONS WHILE PROVIDING NARROWER CONFIDENCE INTERVALS. CONCLUSION: WE FIND THAT THESE LEGEND RESULTS SHOW HIGH INTERNAL VALIDITY AND ARE CONGRUENT WITH META-ANALYSES OF RCTS. FOR THESE REASONS WE BELIEVE THAT EVIDENCE GENERATED BY LEGEND IS OF HIGH QUALITY AND CAN INFORM MEDICAL DECISION-MAKING WHERE EVIDENCE IS CURRENTLY LACKING. SUBSEQUENT PUBLICATIONS WILL EXPLORE THE CLINICAL INTERPRETATIONS OF THIS EVIDENCE.","",10.1093/jamia/ocaa124,0,exclude,33,,exclude,20,,0,exclude

PREPRINTS HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED AS A PRIMARY AND ESSENTIAL METHOD TO DISSEMINATE NEW FINDINGS FASTER THAN TRADITIONAL PUBLICATIONS. THEREFORE, IT HAS BECOME NECESSARY FOR JOURNALS AND EDITORS TO ACKNOWLEDGE THESE CHANGES, PREPARE PREPRINT POLICIES, AND NOTIFY AUTHORS ACCORDINGLY. THIS STUDY AIMED TO REVIEW THE STATUS OF PREPRINT POLICIES OF INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHERS AND ASIAN ACADEMIC SOCIETY JOURNALS. METHODS: IN TOTAL, 383 ASIAN ACADEMIC SOCIETY JOURNALS REGISTERED IN SCIENCE CITATION INDEX EXPANDED WERE SELECTED AS A DATASET FOR ANALYSIS BETWEEN DECEMBER 11, 2020 AND JANUARY 8, 2021. THREE DIFFERENT PARAMETERS WERE INVESTIGATED WHETHER EACH JOURNAL HAD A PREPRINT POLICY, WHETHER JOURNALS ALLOWED PREPRINT MANUSCRIPTS TO BE SUBMITTED, AND WHETHER PREPRINT ARTICLES WERE ALLOWED TO BE INCLUDED IN THE REFERENCES. RESULTS: AMONG THE 383 ASIAN ACADEMIC SOCIETY JOURNALS FROM 22 COUNTRIES, ONLY 28 JOURNALS ACCEPTED PREPRINT MANUSCRIPTS, AND EIGHT ALLOWED THE USE OF PREPRINT MANUSCRIPTS AS REFERENCES. JAPAN HAD THE MOST JOURNALS THAT BOTH HAD PREPRINT POLICIES AND ACCEPTED PREPRINT MANUSCRIPTS, WITH 13 JOURNALS, FOLLOWED BY KOREA WITH 10 JOURNALS. CONCLUSION: DESPITE THE LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY, THE RESULTS SHOW THAT EDITORS AND JOURNAL STAFF SHOULD UNDERSTAND THE CURRENT PREPRINT TREND AND TRY TO PREPARE PREPRINT POLICIES THAT BEST MEET THE JOURNALS' AND AUTHORS' INTERESTS.","",10.6087/kcse.224,0,include,33,,include,20,,0,include

A DIFFERENT APPROACH IS PURSUED HERE, APPLYING FUNCTIONALISM IN HISTORICAL CONTEXT TO EXPLAIN THE EMERGENCE OF THE CHARACTERISTIC ETHOS AND INSTITUTIONS OF `OPEN SCIENCE'. THE EMERGENCE DURING THE LATE SIXTEENTH AND EARLY SEVENTEENTH CENTURIES OF THE IDEA AND PRACTICE OF `OPEN SCIENCE' REPRESENTED A BREAK FROM THE PREVIOUSLY DOMINANT ETHOS OF SECRECY IN THE PURSUIT OF `NATURE'S SECRETS'.

AIM TO TEST THE VALIDITY AND RELIABILITY OF SHI ET AL'S CONCLUSION THAT THE HBSC DATA SHOW AN ASSOCIATION BETWEEN POLICY `LIBERALIZATION' AND INCREASED LIKELIHOOD OF ADOLESCENT CANNABIS USE. METHODS: REPLICATION AND RE-ANALYSIS OF THE SAME POOLED DATA FROM THREE WAVES OF THE HEALTH BEHAVIOUR IN SCHOOL-AGED CHILDREN (HBSC) SURVEY (2001/2, 2005/6 AND 2009/10). THIS REPLICATES AS FAR AS POSSIBLE THE CODING AND ANALYTICAL STRATEGY OF THE SHI ET AL ARTICLE.

RESPIRATION AND THE RELEASE AND UPTAKE OF VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS (VOCS) CREATE DYNAMIC MICROENVIRONMENTS IN BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS. STUDYING THE KINETICS OF VOLATILES IN BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS REQUIRES EXPENSIVE INSTRUMENTS, AND DATA ANALYSIS IS CHALLENGING. THEREFORE, WE AIMED TO DESIGN A MINIMAL ANALYTICAL DEVICE FOR MEASURING THE COMPOSITION OF GASEOUS MIXTURES IN REAL-TIME. WE BUILT THE `MODULAR BIOLOGICAL MASS SPECTROMETER' (MOBIMS) FROM 3D-PRINTED PARTS AND CUSTOM SENSORS TO FIT A WIDE ARRAY OF EXPERIMENTAL SET-UPS. WE TESTED THE CHEMICAL DETECTION RANGE AND TEMPORAL RESOLUTION OF THE MOBIMS EMPLOYING PURE COMPOUNDS AND COMPLEX BIOLOGICAL SAMPLES. COMPOUNDS WITH A HIGHER THAN 0.4 MMHG VAPOR PRESSURE AND A MOLECULAR WEIGHT UP TO 154 G/MOL WERE RELIABLY SENSED WITHIN SECONDS. THE GENERATED ELECTRON IMPACT (EI) SPECTRA WERE DIRECTLY COMPARABLE WITH STANDARD DATABASES LIKE THE NIST EI LIBRARY. UNDER A DIRECT ANALYSIS APPROACH, THE MOBIMS IDENTIFIED THE CHARACTERISTIC ODOR OF BANANA (MUSA SP.), THAT IS, ISOAMYL ACETATE; TRACKED THE DYNAMICS OF CO2 RELEASE WHILE THE ALKA-SELTZER (R) REACTION OCCURRED; AND SHOWED THE KINETICS OF THE TRANSIENT PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION OF CARBON DIOXIDE DURING PHOTOSYNTHESIS.

A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF GEOGRAPHIC VARIATION AND DRIVERS OF COMMONALITIES AND DIFFERENCES ACROSS SALT MARSH SYSTEMS IS ESSENTIAL TO INFORMING FUTURE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.

THESE JUDGEMENTS INCLUDE CHOICES ABOUT WHAT TOPICS TO STUDY; WHAT QUESTIONS TO ASK ABOUT THOSE TOPICS; HOW BEST TO DESIGN STUDIES TO ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS; HOW TO COLLECT, ANALYSE, AND INTERPRET DATA; AND HOW TO FRAME AND COMMUNICATE FINDINGS. RATHER THAN DEFENDING A `VALUE-FREE IDEAL' FOR RESPONDING TO THESE JUDGEMENTS, THE PAPER CALLS FOR A `VALUE-MANAGEMENT IDEAL' BASED ON THREE PRINCIPLES: (1) VALUE-LADEN JUDGEMENTS SHOULD BE HANDLED AS TRANSPARENTLY AS POSSIBLE; (2) THESE JUDGEMENTS SHOULD BE MADE IN WAYS THAT REFLECT SOCIAL AND ETHICAL PRIORITIES; AND (3) THEY SHOULD BE MADE IN A MANNER THAT IS INFORMED BY ENGAGEMENT AMONG INTERESTED AND AFFECTED PARTIES. BASED ON THESE PRINCIPLES, THE PAPER SUGGESTS SEVERAL STRATEGIES FOR MOVING FORWARD TO HANDLE VALUE-LADEN JUDGEMENTS IN REGULATORY SCIENCE AND RISK ASSESSMENT IN A RESPONSIBLE MANNER. FIRST, DECISION MAKERS SHOULD BECOME MORE COMFORTABLE WITH SCIENTIFIC DISAGREEMENT, FINDING WAYS TO RESPECT DIFFERENT POSITIONS ON VALUE-LADEN JUDGEMENTS AND FORMULATE POLICIES DESPITE INCONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE. SECOND, THOSE ENGAGED IN REGULATORY SCIENCE SHOULD EXPLORE CREATIVE WAYS TO CLARIFY IMPORTANT JUDGEMENTS AND COMMUNICATE HOW THEY ARE BEING HANDLED. THIRD, INSTITUTIONAL PROCESSES FOR SETTING STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES FOR REGULATORY SCIENCE AND RISK ASSESSMENT SHOULD BE SCRUTINISED TO ENSURE THAT THEY PROVIDE FAIR OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL INTERESTED AND AFFECTED PARTIES TO PARTICIPATE IN AND INFORM THOSE PROCESSES.

THUS, THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS WORK IS TO ANALYZE THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE OPEN ACCESS (OA) MODALITY TO THE IMPACT OF HYBRID JOURNALS. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: THE ``RESEARCH ARTICLES'' IN THE YEAR 2017 FROM 200 HYBRID JOURNALS IN FOUR SUBJECT AREAS, AND THE CITATIONS RECEIVED BY SUCH ARTICLES IN THE PERIOD 2017-2020 IN THE SCOPUS DATABASE, WERE ANALYZED. THE HYBRID OA PAPERS WERE COMPARED WITH THE PAYWALLED ONES. THE JOURNALS WERE RANDOMLY SELECTED FROM THOSE WITH SHARE OF OA PAPERS HIGHER THAN SOME MINIMAL VALUE. MORE THAN 60 THOUSAND RESEARCH ARTICLES WERE ANALYZED IN THE SAMPLE, OF WHICH 24\% UNDER THE OA MODALITY. FINDINGS: WE OBTAIN AT JOURNAL LEVEL THAT CITES PER ARTICLE IN BOTH HYBRID MODALITIES (OA AND PAY WALLED) STRONGLY CORRELATE. HOWEVER, THERE IS NO CORRELATION BETWEEN THE OA PREVALENCE AND CITES PER ARTICLE. THERE IS OA CITATION ADVANTAGE IN 80\% OF HYBRID JOURNALS. MOREOVER, THE OA CITATION ADVANTAGE IS CONSISTENT ACROSS FIELDS AND HELD IN TIME. WE OBTAIN AN OA CITATION ADVANTAGE OF 50\% IN AVERAGE, AND HIGHER THAN 37\% IN HALF OF THE HYBRID JOURNALS. FINALLY, THE OA CITATION ADVANTAGE IS HIGHER IN HUMANITIES THAN IN SCIENCE AND SOCIAL SCIENCE. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS: SOME OF THE CITATION ADVANTAGE IS LIKELY DUE TO MORE ACCESS ALLOWS MORE PEOPLE TO READ AND HENCE CITE ARTICLES THEY OTHERWISE WOULD NOT. HOWEVER, CAUSATION IS DIFFICULT TO ESTABLISH AND THERE ARE MANY POSSIBLE BIAS. SEVERAL FACTORS CAN AFFECT THE OBSERVED DIFFERENCES IN CITATION RATES. FUNDER MANDATES CAN BE ONE OF THEM. FUNDERS ARE LIKELY TO HAVE OA REQUIREMENT, AND WELL-FUNDED STUDIES ARE MORE LIKELY TO RECEIVE MORE CITATIONS THAN POORLY FUNDED STUDIES. ANOTHER DISCUSSED FACTOR IS THE SELECTION BIAS POSTULATE, WHICH SUGGESTS THAT AUTHORS CHOOSE ONLY THEIR MOST IMPACTFUL STUDIES TO BE OPEN ACCESS. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: FOR HYBRID JOURNALS, THE OPEN ACCESS MODALITY IS POSITIVE, IN THE SENSE THAT IT PROVIDES A GREATER NUMBER OF POTENTIAL READERS. THIS IN TURN TRANSLATES INTO A GREATER NUMBER OF CITATIONS AND AN IMPROVEMENT IN THE POSITION OF THE JOURNAL IN THE RANKINGS BY IMPACT FACTOR. FOR RESEARCHERS IT IS ALSO POSITIVE BECAUSE IT INCREASES THE POTENTIAL NUMBER OF READERS AND CITATIONS RECEIVED. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: OUR STUDY REFINES PREVIOUS RESULTS BY COMPARING DOCUMENTS MORE SIMILAR TO EACH OTHER.

TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION, WE CREATE A NEW DATA SET BY SCRAPING BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA FROM MULTIDISCIPLINARY DIGITAL PUBLISHING INSTITUTE (MDPI) JOURNALS. USING THE FOUR INCOME GROUP CLASSIFICATIONS FROM THE WORLD BANK ANALYTICAL CLASSIFICATIONS, WE FIND THAT RESEARCHERS FROM LOW-INCOME NATIONS ARE MORE LIKELY TO FORM INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATIONS THAN RESEARCHERS FROM WEALTHIER NATIONS.

WE THEN STUDY WHICH NATIONS MOST FREQUENTLY FORM INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATIONS WITH OTHER NATIONS AND FIND THAT THE USA, CHINA, GERMANY, AND FRANCE ARE THE MOST PREFERRED NATIONS FOR FORMING INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATIONS.

THEY ARE SOMETIMES REFERRED TO FONDLY AS PRACTICAL ACADEMICS OR `PRACADEMICS' BECAUSE THEY STILL WORK IN PRIVATE SECTOR AND ALSO ACT AS A VISITING PROFESSOR IN ACADEMIA. I SIT ON EIGHT BOARDS AND CHAIR NEARLY HALF OF THEM, AND SERVE ON AUDIT COMMITTEES AND HR REMUNERATION COMMITTEES. I AM AN EXAMPLE OF A `PRACADEMIC', AND MY INDUCTION INTO ACADEMIA WAS ONE SENTENCE - PUBLISH OR PERISH. IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR, INDUCTION CAN TAKE UP TO A WEEK. I HAD ONE MINUTE. IMPLICATIONS: THE IMPLICATION IS THAT I HAD TO FIND OUT WHAT A PEER-REVIEWED JOURNAL WAS AND TRIP INTO THE FACT THAT SOME PEER-REVIEWED JOURNALS ARE SCAMS AND OTHERS A RATED. TELLING THE DIFFERENCE IN MY INITIAL YEARS TOOK ITS TOLL. I CONTINUALLY HAD TO ASK COLLEAGUES - IS THIS JOURNAL REAL? EVENTUALLY I REALISED THE DHET LIST WAS A GOOD STARTING POINT AND I STARTED SUBMITTING ARTICLES. I GOT MORE REJECTIONS THAN ACCEPTANCES AT FIRST, WITH VERY LITTLE EXPLANATION. SO I LEARNT NOTHING AND DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO TO IMPROVE. I HAD TO WASTE ANOTHER THOUSAND REVIEWER HOURS OF TIME TO LEARN WHAT THE REQUIREMENT WAS. RESEARCH WRITING IS GUIDED BY A PERSONAL PHILOSOPHY, AND IT IS ABOUT WHAT TYPES OF RESEARCH ISSUES ONE IS INCLINED TOWARDS. FOR INSTANCE, SOME PEOPLE ARE NATURALLY INCLINED TOWARDS BASIC RESEARCH AND OTHERS TOWARDS APPLIED RESEARCH. OTHERS ARE MORE ORIENTED TOWARDS THEORY BUILDING AND TESTING TYPES FOR THE PURPOSE OF CREATING KNOWLEDGE FOR THE SAKE OF KNOWLEDGE. SOME OTHERS ARE PRAGMATIC TYPES OR REALIST TYPES AND BELIEVE REAL-WORLD PROBLEMS DO NOT COME NEATLY PACKAGED AND ARE SOMEWHAT UNTIDILY IN PRESENTATION CALLING FOR DISCRETION OR JUDGEMENT ON WHAT TO PRIORITISE FOR RESEARCH AND HOW TO CARRY OUT THE RESEARCH. SOME ARE SCIENTIST PRACTITIONERS (EVIDENCE INFORMED RESEARCHERS) AND OTHERS ARE PRACTITIONER-SCIENTIST (PRACTICE-LED SCIENCE). PERHAPS THIS KIND OF ORIENTATION TO RESEARCH IS WHAT EARLY CAREER RESEARCHERS NEED INITIALLY; THEN, THEY CAN WORRY ABOUT REPRODUCIBILITY OF RESEARCH FINDINGS DOWN THE LINE AFTER GROUNDING THEMSELVES INTO THE RESEARCH SPACE THEY PERCEIVE TO BELONG TO AND WHERE THEY FEEL INVESTED. PURPOSE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS OPINION ARTICLE IS TO SHARE MY JOURNEY AND SOW SOME DOUBT IN REPLY TO THE OPINION PIECE CIRCULATED BY EFENDIC AND VAN ZYL. WHILST I DO AGREE WITH EVERYTHING THAT IS SAID IN THEIR ARTICLE, I BELIEVE THAT THERE IS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT NEEDS TO BE CONSIDERED. CONTEXT IS IMPORTANT. NOT ALL ACADEMICS THAT SUBMIT ARTICLES HAVE BEEN IN ACADEMIA FOR MANY YEARS. WE NEED TO DO MORE TO SUPPORT BUDDING AUTHORS. RECOMMENDATIONS: WE NEED TO BE MUCH MORE HELPFUL TO BUDDING AUTHORS THAN JUST PUBLISHING A PAGE OR TWO CALLED AUTHOR SUBMISSION GUIDELINES. THESE ARE MOSTLY COSMETIC STYLE GUIDES. IF WE WANT A HIGHER QUALITY SUBMISSION AND PLENTY OF THEM - THEN I BELIEVE WE NEED TO EDUCATE OUR BUDDING AUTHORS OF THE REQUIREMENTS. PERHAPS WE NEED A DETAILED GUIDE, SIMILAR IN CONTENT AND DEPTH AS THE ARTICLE OF EFENDIC AND VAN ZYL (2019). WE COULD CONSIDER A PODCAST SETTING OUT THE TECHNICAL GUIDELINES AND STATISTICAL REQUIREMENTS. RUNNING COURSES ON ARTICLE PUBLISHING BY THE REVIEWERS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT IS FROM THE HORSE'S MOUTH. TRUST ME; IT IS NOT JUST A CASE OF STICKING TO THE STYLE GUIDE.

THE DATA SHOW THAT PEOPLE CARE GREATLY ABOUT RESEARCH DEALING WITH HUMANS: LINKS TAGGED AS PSYCHOLOGY, SOCIAL SCIENCES, AND HEALTH ARE UPVOTED MORE THAN OTHER CATEGORIES ON REDDIT. WITHIN THE CATEGORY OF PSYCHOLOGY, ARTICLES WERE CODED BASED ON THE TOPIC OF RESEARCH. ARTICLES DEALING GENERALLY WITH SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGICAL TOPICS ARE AMONG THE HIGHEST IN NUMBER AND UPVOTES ON THE SUBREDDIT R/SCIENCE. MANY POSTS WERE UPVOTED TENS OF THOUSANDS OF TIMES. HOWEVER, UPVOTES ON REDDIT ARE UNRELATED TO SCIENTIFIC PUBLISHING METRICS (E.G., IMPACT FACTOR, JOURNAL RANKINGS, AND CITATIONS), SUGGESTING A DISCONNECT BETWEEN WHAT PSYCHOLOGISTS AND REDDITORS MAY SEE AS RELEVANT. THESE FINDINGS ALSO HIGHLIGHT SOME POINTS FOR REFLECTION. FOR EXAMPLE, PSYCHOLOGISTS MAY BENEFIT FROM THINKING ABOUT THE PURPOSE, GOALS, AND BENEFICIARIES OF THE RESEARCH THEY PURSUE. ADDITIONALLY, THE LEVEL OF ATTENTION THAT SOME PSYCHOLOGICAL RESEARCH RECEIVES HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR TRANSPARENT RESEARCH PRACTICES.

THIS CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY AIMED TO DESCRIBE WHETHER AND HOW RELEVANT POLICIES OF UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTRES IN GERMANY SUPPORT THE ROBUST AND TRANSPARENT CONDUCT OF RESEARCH AND HOW PREVALENT TRADITIONAL METRICS ARE. METHODS FOR 38 GERMAN UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTRES, WE SEARCHED FOR INSTITUTIONAL POLICIES FOR ACADEMIC DEGREES AND ACADEMIC APPOINTMENTS AS WELL AS WEBSITES FOR THEIR CORE FACILITIES AND RESEARCH IN GENERAL BETWEEN DECEMBER 2020 AND FEBRUARY 2021. WE SCREENED THE DOCUMENTS FOR MENTIONS OF INDICATORS OF ROBUST AND TRANSPARENT RESEARCH (STUDY REGISTRATION; REPORTING OF RESULTS; SHARING OF RESEARCH DATA, CODE AND PROTOCOLS; OPEN ACCESS; AND MEASURES TO INCREASE ROBUSTNESS) AND FOR MENTIONS OF MORE TRADITIONAL METRICS OF CAREER PROGRESSION (NUMBER OF PUBLICATIONS; NUMBER AND VALUE OF AWARDED GRANTS; IMPACT FACTORS; AND AUTHORSHIP ORDER). RESULTS WHILE OPEN ACCESS WAS MENTIONED IN 16\% OF PHD REGULATIONS, OTHER INDICATORS OF ROBUST AND TRANSPARENT RESEARCH WERE MENTIONED IN LESS THAN 10\% OF INSTITUTIONAL POLICIES FOR ACADEMIC DEGREES AND ACADEMIC APPOINTMENTS. THESE INDICATORS WERE MORE FREQUENTLY MENTIONED ON THE CORE FACILITY AND GENERAL RESEARCH WEBSITES. INSTITUTIONAL POLICIES FOR ACADEMIC DEGREES AND ACADEMIC APPOINTMENTS HAD FREQUENT MENTIONS OF TRADITIONAL METRICS.

THE VARIETY OF DATA REPOSITORIES AND JOURNALS REFLECT THAT LTG SCIENTISTS TARGET MANY DIFFERENT SCIENTIFIC QUESTIONS, PRODUCE DATA WITH EXTREMELY DIFFERENT STRUCTURES AND VOLUMES, AND UTILIZE COPIOUS AND COMPLEX METADATA. NONETHELESS, THE GROUP AGREED THAT PUBLICATION OF LTG SCIENCE MUST BE ACCOMPANIED BY SHARING OF DATA IN PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE REPOSITORIES, AND, FOR SAMPLE-BASED DATA, REGISTRATION OF SAMPLES WITH GLOBALLY UNIQUE PERSISTENT IDENTIFIERS. LTG SCIENTISTS SHOULD USE CERTIFIED DATA REPOSITORIES THAT ARE EITHER HIGHLY STRUCTURED DATABASES DESIGNED FOR SPECIALIZED TYPES OF DATA, OR UNSTRUCTURED GENERALIZED DATA SYSTEMS.

DATA IS COLLECTED ALL OVER THE WORLD AND NEEDS TO BE INTEGRATED AND MADE AVAILABLE TO OTHER RESEARCHERS QUICKLY. HOWEVER, THE VARIOUS HETEROGENEOUS INFORMATION SYSTEMS THAT ARE USED IN HOSPITALS CAN RESULT IN FRAGMENTATION OF HEALTH DATA OVER MULTIPLE DATA `SILOS' THAT ARE NOT INTEROPERABLE FOR ANALYSIS. CONSEQUENTLY, CLINICAL OBSERVATIONS IN HOSPITALISED PATIENTS ARE NOT PREPARED TO BE REUSED EFFICIENTLY AND TIMELY. THERE IS A NEED TO ADAPT THE RESEARCH DATA MANAGEMENT IN HOSPITALS TO MAKE COVID-19 OBSERVATIONAL PATIENT DATA MACHINE ACTIONABLE, I.E.

RESULTS IN THIS PAPER, WE PRESENT OUR FAIR APPROACH TO TRANSFORM COVID-19 OBSERVATIONAL PATIENT DATA COLLECTED IN THE HOSPITAL INTO MACHINE ACTIONABLE DIGITAL OBJECTS TO ANSWER MEDICAL DOCTORS' RESEARCH QUESTIONS. WITH THIS OBJECTIVE, WE CONDUCTED A COORDINATED FAIRIFICATION AMONG STAKEHOLDERS BASED ON ONTOLOGICAL MODELS FOR DATA AND METADATA, AND A FAIR BASED ARCHITECTURE THAT COMPLEMENTS THE EXISTING DATA MANAGEMENT. WE APPLIED FAIR DATA POINTS FOR METADATA EXPOSURE, TURNING INVESTIGATIONAL PARAMETERS INTO A FAIR DATASET.

INVESTIGATING WHETHER AND HOW WIKIPEDIA REMAINED UP TO DATE AND IN LINE WITH SCIENCE IS KEY TO FORMULATING STRATEGIES TO COUNTER MISINFORMATION. USING CITATION ANALYSES, WE ASKED WHICH SOURCES INFORMED WIKIPEDIA'S COVID-19-RELATED ARTICLES BEFORE AND DURING THE PANDEMIC'S FIRST WAVE (JANUARY-MAY 2020). RESULTS WE FOUND THAT CORONAVIRUS-RELATED ARTICLES REFERENCED TRUSTED MEDIA OUTLETS AND HIGH-QUALITY ACADEMIC SOURCES. REGARDING ACADEMIC SOURCES, WIKIPEDIA WAS FOUND TO BE HIGHLY SELECTIVE IN TERMS OF WHAT SCIENCE WAS CITED. MOREOVER, DESPITE A SURGE IN COVID-19 PREPRINTS, WIKIPEDIA HAD A CLEAR PREFERENCE FOR OPEN-ACCESS STUDIES PUBLISHED IN RESPECTED JOURNALS AND MADE LITTLE USE OF PREPRINTS. BUILDING A TIMELINE OF ENGLISH-LANGUAGE COVID-19 ARTICLES FROM 2001-2020 REVEALED A NUANCED TRADE-OFF BETWEEN QUALITY AND TIMELINESS. IT FURTHER SHOWED HOW PRE-EXISTING ARTICLES ON KEY TOPICS RELATED TO THE VIRUS CREATED A FRAMEWORK FOR INTEGRATING NEW KNOWLEDGE. SUPPORTED BY A RIGID SOURCING POLICY, THIS ``SCIENTIFIC INFRASTRUCTURE'' FACILITATED CONTEXTUALIZATION AND REGULATED THE INFLUX OF NEW INFORMATION.

THIS PRE-REGISTERED META-ANALYSIS INTEGRATED THE EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH ON ENVIRONMENTAL SPILLOVER TO UPDATE A PREVIOUS META-ANALYSIS (MAKI ET AL., 2019). DATABASE SEARCHES IN SEVERAL LANGUAGES SUPPLEMENTED BY SEARCHES TO RETRIEVE UNPUBLISHED LITERATURE YIELDED 63 AGGREGATED EFFECT SIZES FROM 38 STUDIES AND 29 ARTICLES (N = 26,613 UNIQUE PARTICIPANTS). A THREE-LEVEL BAYESIAN META-ANALYSIS PROVIDED WEAK SUPPORT FOR NO SPILLOVER ON INTENTIONS AND STRONG SUPPORT FOR NO SPILLOVER ON BEHAVIORS. IF SPILLOVER WAS PRESENT, IT WOULD LIKELY BE SMALL AND POSITIVE FOR INTENTIONS, DELTA = 0.15, 95\% CRI [-0.01, 0.31], BUT NEGLIGIBLE FOR BEHAVIORS, DELTA = 0.01, 95\% CRI [-0.13, 0.16]. POSITIVE SPILLOVER WAS MOST LIKELY WHEN INTERVENTIONS WERE AUTONOMY-SUPPORTIVE (VERY STRONG EVIDENCE), PROVIDED A RATIONALE (MODERATE TO STRONG EVIDENCE), DID NOT USE FINANCIAL (DIS)INCENTIVES (WEAK TO STRONG EVIDENCE), AND ADDRESSED NORMATIVE (EXTREME EVIDENCE) OR A COMBINATION OF NORMATIVE AND PERSONAL GAIN GOALS (STRONG EVIDENCE). SPILLOVER WAS SIMILAR ACROSS RESEARCH SETTINGS (MODERATE EVIDENCE) AND PARTLY ACROSS SAMPLES (WEAK TO MODERATE EVIDENCE), WHICH MAY SUGGEST GENERALIZABILITY. TO SET STANDARDS FOR ROBUST SPILLOVER RESEARCH, WE DEVELOPED THE POWER-REPORTING-OPEN SCIENCE (PRO) GUIDELINES. THE BAYESIAN APPROACH ALLOWS FOR ROBUST CONCLUSIONS AND CONTINUOUS UPDATING WITH NEW EVIDENCE.

OBJECTIVE: WE PRESENT THE VIRDB DATABASE (VIRDB.CS.PUT.POZNAN.PL), WHICH HAS TWO PRIMARY OBJECTIVES. FIRST, IT IS A TOOL THAT ENABLES COLLECTING DATA ON VIRAL INFECTIONS THAT COULD BE USED TO DEVELOP NEW DYNAMIC MODELS OF INFECTIONS USING THE FAIR DATA SHARING PRINCIPLES. SECOND, IT ALLOWS STORING REFERENCES TO DESCRIPTIONS OF VIRAL INFECTION MODELS, TOGETHER WITH THEIR EVALUATION RESULTS. METHODS: TO FACILITATE THE FAST POPULATION OF DATABASE AND THE EASE OF EXCHANGE OF SCIENTIFIC DATA, WE DECIDED TO USE CROWDSOURCING FOR COLLECTING DATA. SUCH APPROACH HAS ALREADY BEEN PROVED TO BE VERY SUCCESSFUL IN PROJECTS SUCH AS WIKIPEDIA.

THE PROCEDURE FOR DETECTING BURSTS OF MSNA AND CALCULATING BURST METRICS IS TEDIOUS AND DIFFERS WIDELY AMONG LABORATORIES WORLDWIDE. WE SOUGHT TO DEVELOP AN OPEN-SOURCE, CROSS-PLATFORM WEB APPLICATION THAT PROVIDES A STANDARDIZED APPROACH FOR BURST IDENTIFICATION AND A TOOL TO INCREASE RESEARCH REPRODUCIBILITY FOR THOSE MEASURING MSNA. WE COMPARED THE PERFORMANCE OF THIS WEB APPLICATION AGAINST A MANUAL SCORING APPROACH UNDER CONDITIONS OF REST, CHEMOREFLEX ACTIVATION (N = 9, 20-MIN ISOCAPNIC HYPOXIA), AND METABOREFLEX ACTIVATION (N = 13, 2-MIN ISOMETRIC HANDGRIP EXERCISE AND 4-MIN POSTEXERCISE CIRCULATORY OCCLUSION).

OBJECTIVE: THE OBJECTIVE OF THE CURRENT PAPER IS TO UNDERSTAND IF THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK (ESPECIALLY AT A TRANSNATIONAL LEVEL) MAY ACTUALLY HELP TO ACHIEVE THE OBJECTIVES LAID DOWN BY PRINCIPLE 7 OR IF SOME INTERPRETATIVE OR LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS WILL BE NECESSARY. METHODS: THE PAPER ANALYSES THE LEGAL SOURCES AT INTERNATIONAL AND EU LEVELS. RESULTS: THE APPLICABLE RULES ARE BASED ON THE IDEA THAT THE INFORMATION AND MATERIAL ARE FORMS OF `PROPERTY' OF THE INDIVIDUALS OR OF THE STATES (I.E., THE SOVEREIGN). ACCORDING TO THE TRADITIONAL IDEA OF PROPERTY, THE OWNER HAS A SORT OF ABSOLUTE POWER OVER THE RES AND IS ENTITLED TO EXCLUDE OTHERS FROM ANY RIGHTS OVER THE THING. THE `PROPERTY PARADIGM' MAY BE USEFUL TO PROTECT SOME RELEVANT INTERESTS, BUT IT CAN ALSO AFFECT COLLECTIVE INTERESTS, SUCH AS THOSE CONCERNING HEALTH DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. CONCLUSIONS: IN ORDER TO BUILD A GLOBAL SYSTEM FOR THE EXCHANGE OF DATA AND MATERIALS AS PROVIDED FOR BY PRINCIPLE 7 OF THE ROME DECLARATION, A NEW LEGAL APPROACH SHOULD BE ELABORATED WHICH TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION THE INTERNATIONAL CORPUS OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING RESEARCH FREEDOM, THE RIGHT TO HEALTH AND THE PRINCIPLE OF TRANSNATIONAL `DIGITAL' SOLIDARITY.","",10.3233/JRS-227002,0,include,1,,include,2,,0,include

THESE BROAD TROPHIC STATE CLASSIFICATIONS ARE GOOD PREDICTORS OF ECOSYSTEM CONDITION, SERVICES (E.G., RECREATION AND ESTHETICS), AND DISSERVICES (E.G., HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS). WHILE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN NUTRIENTS AND TROPHIC STATE PROVIDES RELIABLE PREDICTIONS, IT REQUIRES IN SITU WATER QUALITY DATA TO PARAMETERIZE THE MODEL. THIS LIMITS THE APPLICATION OF THESE MODELS TO LAKES WITH EXISTING AND, MORE IMPORTANTLY, AVAILABLE WATER QUALITY DATA. TO ADDRESS THIS, WE TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE AVAILABILITY OF A LARGE NATIONAL LAKES WATER QUALITY DATABASE (I.E., THE NATIONAL LAKES ASSESSMENT), LAND-USE/LAND-COVER DATA, LAKE MORPHOMETRY DATA, AND OTHER UNIVERSALLY AVAILABLE DATA, AND WE APPLY DATA-MINING APPROACHES TO PREDICT TROPHIC STATE. USING THESE DATA AND RANDOM FORESTS, WE FIRST MODEL CHLOROPHYLL A AND THEN CLASSIFY THE RESULTANT PREDICTIONS INTO TROPHIC STATES. THE FULL MODEL ESTIMATES CHLOROPHYLL A WITH BOTH IN SITU AND UNIVERSALLY AVAILABLE DATA. THE MEAN-SQUARED ERROR AND ADJUSTED R-2 OF THIS MODEL WAS 0.09 AND 0.8, RESPECTIVELY. THE SECOND MODEL USES UNIVERSALLY AVAILABLE GIS DATA ONLY. THE MEAN-SQUARED ERROR WAS 0.22, AND THE ADJUSTED R-2 WAS 0.48. THE KAPPA COEFFICIENTS OF THE TROPHIC STATE CLASSIFICATIONS DERIVED FROM THE CHLOROPHYLL A PREDICTIONS WERE 0.57 FOR THE FULL MODEL AND 0.29 FOR THE GIS-ONLY MODEL. RANDOM FORESTS EXTEND THE USEFULNESS OF THE CLASS PREDICTIONS BY PROVIDING PREDICTION PROBABILITIES FOR EACH LAKE. THIS ALLOWS US TO MAKE TROPHIC STATE PREDICTIONS AND ALSO INDICATE THE LEVEL OF UNCERTAINTY AROUND THOSE PREDICTIONS. FOR THE FULL MODEL, THESE PREDICTED CLASS PROBABILITIES RANGED FROM 0.42 TO 1.

SPECIFIC INDICATORS OF REPRODUCIBLE AND TRANSPARENT RESEARCH PRACTICES WERE EVALUATED IN A BLINDED, INDEPENDENT, AND DUPLICATE MANNER USING A PILOT-TESTED GOOGLE FORM. RESULTS OUR INITIAL SEARCH RETURNED 26,498 RECORDS, FROM WHICH 300 WERE RANDOMLY SELECTED FOR ANALYSIS. OF THESE 300 RECORDS, 286 MET INCLUSION CRITERIA AND 14 DID NOT. AMONG THE EMPIRICAL STUDIES, 2\% (95\% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI]: 0.4\%-3.5\%) OF PUBLICATIONS INDICATED THAT RAW DATA WERE AVAILABLE, 0.6\% (95\% CI: 0.3\%-1.6\%) REPORTED AN ANALYSIS SCRIPT, 5.3\% (95\% CI: 2.7\%-7.8\%) WERE LINKED TO AN ACCESSIBLE RESEARCH PROTOCOL, AND 3.9\% (95\% CI: 1.7\%-6.1\%) WERE PREREGISTERED.

NOWADAYS, LIBRARIANS ARE VERY MUCH IMPLIED IN SEARCH OF SCIENTIFIC OPEN ACCESS INFORMATION, IN ORDER TO SUPPORT KNOWLEDGE PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION IN RESEARCH INSTITUTES AND UNIVERSITIES. THERE ARE A LOT OF INTERNATIONAL SUCCESS MODELS FOR OPEN ACCESS, AND THIS ASPECT IS VERY SIGNIFICANT FOR ROMANIAN LIBRARIANS, IN ORDER TO PROPERLY ASSIST RESEARCHERS IN THEIR WORK. THE MOST IMPORTANT PUBLISHERS SUPPORT BOTH GOLD AND GREEN OPEN ACCESS, AND, IN MATTERS PERTAINING THIS LATTER OPTION, LIBRARIES OFFER THEIR SUPPORT BY PAYING SUBSCRIPTIONS TO JOURNALS WITH OPEN ARCHIVE. AS AN EXAMPLE OF POSITIVE ATTITUDE REGARDING OPEN ACCESS AND, IMPLICITLY, OPEN SCIENCE, A SERIES OF RESEARCHERS AT THE INSTITUTE OF MATHEMATICS OF THE ROMANIAN ACADEMY (IMAR) PUBLISH THEIR ARTICLES IN OPEN ACCESS, AND THEIR WORKS CAN BE READ FREE FROM EUDML (THE EUROPEAN DIGITAL MATHEMATICS LIBRARY), ON THEIR PERSONAL PAGES WHICH CAN BE ACCESSED FROM THE WEB-PAGE OF IMAR, OR IN JOURNALS WITH OPEN ACCESS POLICIES. THE ARTICLE AIMS TO PRESENT THE RESULTS OF A SURVEY ON OPINIONS AND APPROACHES OF IMAR'S RESEARCHERS REGARDING OPEN ACCESS PUBLISHING. DIGITAL PRESERVATION AND DATA MANAGEMENT ARE, ALSO, VITAL FOR RESEARCH LIBRARIES IN CONTEMPORARY DIGITAL AGE. LIBRARIANS SUPPORTING RESEARCHERS IN INSTITUTES AND UNIVERSITIES MUST ALSO COMPLY WITH THE ETHICS PRINCIPLES OF OPEN ACCESS, IN TERMS OF COPYRIGHT AND LICENSING ISSUES, AND SO THEY CAN BETTER CARRY OUT THEIR MISSION BY SUPPORTING AUTHORS IN PUBLISHING IN OPEN ACCESS THEIR HIGH QUALITY RESULTS, IN THE CONTEXT OF THE SCIENTIFIC DEVELOPMENTS IN THE MODERN WORLD.","",10.12753/2066-026X-18-273,0,include,43,,include,30,,0,include

FINDINGS - ALTHOUGH UNIFORM RESOURCE IDENTIFIERS CAN BE CONSIDERED LANGUAGE-INDEPENDENT, THEY DO NOT RENDER CONCEPT SCHEMES AND THEIR CONSTRUCTION FREE OF LANGUAGE-RELATED CHALLENGES. THE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE WITH ALL THE CHALLENGES FACED IS HOW TO MAINTAIN CONSISTENCY AND PREDICTABILITY WHEN THE NATURE OF LANGUAGE REQUIRES EACH CONCEPT TO BE TREATED INDIVIDUALLY. THE KEY TO SUCH CHALLENGES IS TO RECOGNISE THE FUNCTION OF THE VOCABULARY AND THE NEEDS OF ITS INTENDED USERS. SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS - OPEN SCIENCE INCREASES THE TRANSPARENCY OF NOT ONLY RESEARCH PRODUCTS, BUT ALSO METADATA TOOLS. GAINING A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF THE CHALLENGES INVOLVED IN THEIR CONSTRUCTION IS IMPORTANT FOR A GREAT VARIETY OF USERS - E.G. INDEXERS, VOCABULARY BUILDERS AND INFORMATION SEEKERS.

SUCH A COMMUNITY CAN BENEFIT FROM RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY (ICT). WE EXAMINE HOW SUCH DEVELOPMENTS CAN BE LEVERAGED TO DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT THE NEXT GENERATION OF DATA, MODELS, AND DECISION SUPPORT TOOLS FOR AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION SYSTEMS.

SHARING DATA FROM COMPLETED RESEARCH STUDIES NOT ONLY SAVES RESEARCH DOLLARS REQUIRED TO COLLECT DATA, BUT ALSO HELPS INSURE THAT STUDIES ARE BOTH REPLICABLE AND REPRODUCIBLE. THE CANCER IMAGING ARCHIVE (TCIA) IS A GLOBAL SHARED REPOSITORY FOR IMAGING DATA RELATED TO CANCER. INSURING THE CONSISTENCY, SCIENTIFIC UTILITY, AND ANONYMITY OF DATA STORED IN TCIA IS OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE. AS THE RATE OF SUBMISSION TO TCIA HAS BEEN INCREASING, BOTH IN VOLUME AND COMPLEXITY OF DICOM OBJECTS STORED, THE PROCESS OF CURATION OF COLLECTIONS HAS BECOME A BOTTLENECK IN ACQUISITION OF DATA. IN ORDER TO INCREASE THE RATE OF CURATION OF IMAGE SETS, IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF THE CURATION, AND BETTER TRACK THE PROVENANCE OF CHANGES MADE TO SUBMITTED DICOM IMAGE SETS, A CUSTOM SET OF TOOLS WAS DEVELOPED, USING NOVEL METHODS FOR THE ANALYSIS OF DICOM DATA SETS.

THE NATIONAL HARVEST SURVEY IS AN ANNUAL SURVEY OF HUNTERS WHO PURCHASE CANADA'S MANDATORY MIGRATORY GAME BIRD HUNTING PERMIT, INTEGRATING INFORMATION FROM A SURVEY OF HUNTING ACTIVITY WITH INFORMATION FROM A SEPARATE SURVEY OF SPECIES COMPOSITION IN THE HARVEST. WE USED THESE SURVEY DATA TO ESTIMATE THE NUMBER OF BIRDS HARVESTED FOR EACH SPECIES AND HUNTING ACTIVITY METRICS (E.G., NUMBER OF ACTIVE HUNTERS, DAYS SPENT HUNTING). THE ANALYTICAL METHODS USED TO GENERATE THESE ESTIMATES HAVE NOT CHANGED SINCE THE SURVEY WAS FIRST DESIGNED IN THE EARLY 1970S. WE DESCRIBE A NEW HIERARCHICAL BAYESIAN INTEGRATED MODEL, WHICH REPLACES THE SERIES OF RATIO ESTIMATORS THAT COMPRISED THE OLD MODEL. WE ARE USING THIS NEW MODEL TO GENERATE ESTIMATES FOR MIGRATORY BIRD HARVESTS AS OF THE 2019-2020 HUNTING SEASON, AND TO GENERATE UPDATED ESTIMATES FOR ALL EARLIER YEARS. THE HIERARCHICAL BAYESIAN MODEL USES OVER-DISPERSED POISSON DISTRIBUTIONS TO MODEL MEAN HUNTER ACTIVITY AND HARVEST (ZERO-INFLATED POISSON AND ZERO-TRUNCATED POISSON, RESPECTIVELY). IT ALSO INCLUDES MULTINOMIAL DISTRIBUTIONS TO MODEL SOME KEY COMPONENTS (E.G., VARIATION IN HARVEST ACROSS PERIODS OF THE HUNTING SEASON, THE SPECIES COMPOSITION OF THE HARVEST WITHIN EACH OF THOSE PERIODS, THE AGE AND SEX COMPOSITION IN THE HARVESTS OF A GIVEN SPECIES). WE ESTIMATED THE PARAMETERS OF THE POISSON AND THE MULTINOMIAL DISTRIBUTIONS FOR EACH YEAR AS RANDOM EFFECTS USING FIRST-DIFFERENCE TIME-SERIES. THIS TIME-SERIES COMPONENT ALLOWS THE MODEL TO SHARE INFORMATION ACROSS YEARS AND REDUCES THE SENSITIVITY OF THE ESTIMATES TO ANNUAL SAMPLING NOISE. THE NEW MODEL ESTIMATES ARE GENERALLY VERY SIMILAR TO THOSE FROM THE OLD MODEL, PARTICULARLY FOR THE SPECIES THAT OCCUR MOST COMMONLY IN THE HARVEST, SO THE RESULTS DO NOT SUGGEST ANY MAJOR CHANGES TO HARVEST MANAGEMENT DECISIONS AND REGULATIONS. ESTIMATES FOR ALL SPECIES FROM THE NEW MODEL ARE MORE PRECISE AND LESS SUSCEPTIBLE TO ANNUAL SAMPLING ERROR, PARTICULARLY FOR SPECIES THAT OCCUR LESS COMMONLY IN THE HARVEST (E.G., SEA DUCKS, OTHER SPECIES OF CONSERVATION CONCERN).

ONE CHALLENGE OF WORKING WITH STORYTELLING IS THAT IT IS VERY OFTEN RETROSPECTIVE AND LINKED TO PAST EXPERIENCES AND MEMORIES. IT CAN BE SEEN AS A BACKWARD-LOOKING ACTIVITY, LEARNING PRINCIPALLY FROM WHAT HAS HAPPENED BEFORE. THE PARTICIPATORY APPROACHES APPLIED IN DRY DEMONSTRATED THAT STORYTELLING CAN BE ALSO USED TO IMAGINE, INTERROGATE AND PLAN FOR A FUTURE THAT COMMUNITIES MIGHT COLLECTIVELY WISH TO SUBSCRIBE OR ADAPT TO. IN PARTICULAR, BY CO-DESIGNING AND FACILITATING STORYBOARDING WORKSHOPS, THE DRY TEAM, TOGETHER WITH LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS, HAVE BEEN EXPLORING THE `SCENARIO-ING' OF POSSIBLE FUTURES AS A WAY OF CREATING A STORY AND VISUALIZING A PICTURE FOR THE FUTURE OF THE COMMUNITY. BY ALLOWING THE SCIENTISTS, COMMUNITY AND LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS TO DEVELOP MODEL DROUGHT SCENARIOS ITERATIVELY TOGETHER USING STORYTELLING, THESE SCENARIOS SHOULD NOT ONLY BE SCIENTIFICALLY ACCURATE, BUT SHOULD ALSO REFLECT LOCAL INTERESTS AND ASPIRATIONS, AS WELL AS LOCAL DROUGHT MITIGATION PRACTICES.

THEN, THE LOCAL ROBUST STATISTICS ARE USED TO DESCRIBE THE OBJECT FEATURES, AND SUCH FEATURES ARE LEARNED ADAPTIVELY FROM THE SEEDS UNDER A NON-PARAMETRIC ESTIMATION SCHEME. SUBSEQUENTLY, SEVERAL ACTIVE CONTOURS EVOLVE SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH THEIR INTERACTIONS BEING MOTIVATED BY THE PRINCIPLES OF ACTION AND REACTION-THIS NOT ONLY GUARANTEES MUTUAL EXCLUSIVENESS AMONG THE CONTOURS, BUT ALSO NO LONGER RELIES UPON THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE MULTIPLE OBJECTS FILL THE ENTIRE IMAGE DOMAIN, WHICH WAS TACITLY OR EXPLICITLY ASSUMED IN MANY PREVIOUS WORKS. IN DOING SO, THE CONTOURS INTERACT AND CONVERGE TO EQUILIBRIUM AT THE DESIRED POSITIONS OF THE DESIRED MULTIPLE OBJECTS. FURTHERMORE, WITH THE AIM OF NOT ONLY VALIDATING THE ALGORITHM AND THE SOFTWARE, BUT ALSO DEMONSTRATING HOW THE TOOL IS TO BE USED, WE PROVIDE THE READER REPRODUCIBLE EXPERIMENTS THAT DEMONSTRATE THE CAPABILITY OF THE PROPOSED SEGMENTATION TOOL ON SEVERAL PUBLIC AVAILABLE DATA SETS.

WE EXTRACTED AND COMPARED INFORMATION ABOUT NONSYSTEMATIC AES (I.E., AES THAT WERE NOT ASSESSED FOR EVERY PARTICIPANT), INCLUDING AES CATEGORIZED AS ``SERIOUS.'' WE RECORDED WHETHER AES WERE GROUPED BY ANATOMIC OR PHYSIOLOGICAL SYSTEM. RESULTS: TRIALS OF THE SAME DRUG REPORTED INFORMATION ABOUT DIFFERENT AES.

OF TRIALS WITH ONLY PUBLIC SOURCES, 2/15 (13\%) GABAPENTIN AND 0/3 (0\%) QUETIAPINE TRIALS GROUPED AES BY ANATOMIC OR PHYSIOLOGICAL SYSTEM. CONCLUSION: PUBLIC SOURCES CONTAINED LITTLE INFORMATION ABOUT NONSYSTEMATIC AES, INCLUDING SERIOUS AES. GROUPING MIGHT MAKE NONSYSTEMATIC AES EASIER TO DETECT; HOWEVER, MOST PUBLIC SOURCES DID NOT REPORT GROUPED AES.

AS ONE OF THE EU?S LEADING INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES, GERMANY HAS ADOPTED SEVERAL CLIMATE-ACTION PLANS FOR THE REALISTIC IMPLEMENTATION AND MAXIMUM UTILIZATION OF RENEWABLE ENERGIES IN ITS ENERGY SYSTEM. THE LITERATURE REVIEW SHOWS A CLEAR GAP IN COMPREHENSIVE TECHNIQUES DESCRIBING AN OPEN MODELING APPROACH FOR ANALYZING FULLY RENEWABLE AND SECTOR-COUPLED ENERGY SYSTEMS. THIS PAPER OUTLINES A METHOD FOR ANALYZING THE 100\% RENEWABLE-BASED AND SECTOR-COUPLED ENERGY SYSTEM?S FEASIBILITY IN GERMANY. BASED ON THE OPEN ENERGY MODELING FRAMEWORK, AN HOURLY OPTIMIZATION TOOL ?OSEEM-DE? IS DEVELOPED TO INVESTIGATE THE GERMAN ENERGY SYSTEM. THE MODEL RESULTS SHOW THAT A 100\% RENEWABLE-BASED AND SECTOR-COUPLED SYSTEM FOR ELECTRICITY AND BUILDING HEAT IS FEASIBLE IN GERMANY. THE IN-VESTMENT CAPACITIES AND COMPONENT COSTS DEPEND ON THE PARAMETRIC VARIATIONS OF THE DEVELOPED SCENARIOS. THE ANNUAL INVESTMENT COSTS VARY BETWEEN 17.6 AND 26.6 BN ?/YR FOR VOLATILE GENERATORS AND BETWEEN 23.7 AND 28.8 BN ?/YR FOR HEAT GENERATORS. THE MODEL SUGGESTS AN INVESTMENT OF A MINIMUM OF 2.7?3.9 BN ?/YR FOR ELECTRICITY AND HEAT STORAGE. COMPARISON OF OSEEM-DE RESULTS WITH RECENT STUDIES VALIDATES THE PERCENTAGE-WISE ENERGY MIX COMPOSITION AND THE CALCULATED LEVELIZED COST OF ELECTRICITY (LCOE) VALUES FROM THE MODEL. SENSITIVITY ANALYSES INDICATE THAT STORAGE AND GRID EXPANSION MAXIMIZE THE SYSTEM?S FLEXIBILITY AND DECREASE THE INVESTMENT COST.

CONFRONTED WITH THE DILEMMA OF A MULTITUDE OF INFORMATION WITH AMBIGUOUS RELEVANCE FOR THEIR SPECIFIC EXPERIMENTS, SCIENTISTS RUN THE RISK OF OVERLOOKING CRITICAL FACTORS THAT CAN INFLUENCE THE PLANNING, CONDUCT AND RESULTS OF STUDIES AND THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED A PRIORI. TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM, WE DEVELOPED ``PEERS'' (PLATFORM FOR THE EXCHANGE OF EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH STANDARDS), AN OPEN-ACCESS ONLINE PLATFORM THAT IS BUILT TO AID SCIENTISTS IN DETERMINING WHICH EXPERIMENTAL FACTORS AND VARIABLES ARE MOST LIKELY TO AFFECT THE OUTCOME OF A SPECIFIC TEST, MODEL OR ASSAY AND THEREFORE OUGHT TO BE CONSIDERED DURING THE DESIGN, EXECUTION AND REPORTING STAGES. THE PEERS DATABASE IS CATEGORIZED INTO IN VIVO AND IN VITRO EXPERIMENTS AND PROVIDES LISTS OF FACTORS DERIVED FROM SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE THAT HAVE BEEN DEEMED CRITICAL FOR EXPERIMENTATION. THE PLATFORM IS BASED ON A STRUCTURED AND TRANSPARENT SYSTEM FOR RATING THE STRENGTH OF EVIDENCE RELATED TO EACH IDENTIFIED FACTOR AND ITS RELEVANCE FOR A SPECIFIC METHOD/MODEL. IN THIS CONTEXT, THE RATING PROCEDURE WILL NOT SOLELY BE LIMITED TO THE PEERS WORKING GROUP BUT WILL ALSO ALLOW FOR A COMMUNITY-BASED GRADING OF EVIDENCE.

COLLECTIVELY, BY HELPING SCIENTISTS SEARCH FOR SPECIFIC FACTORS RELEVANT TO THEIR EXPERIMENTS, AND TO SHARE EXPERIMENTAL KNOWLEDGE IN A STANDARDIZED MANNER, PEERS WILL SERVE AS A COLLABORATIVE EXCHANGE AND ANALYSIS TOOL TO ENHANCE DATA VALIDITY AND ROBUSTNESS AS WELL AS THE REPRODUCIBILITY OF PRECLINICAL RESEARCH. PEERS OFFERS A VETTED, INDEPENDENT TOOL BY WHICH TO JUDGE THE QUALITY OF INFORMATION AVAILABLE ON A CERTAIN TEST OR MODEL, IDENTIFIES KNOWLEDGE GAPS AND PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON THE KEY METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS THAT SHOULD BE PRIORITIZED TO ENSURE THAT PRECLINICAL RESEARCH IS CONDUCTED TO THE HIGHEST STANDARDS AND BEST PRACTICE.","",10.3389/fnbeh.2021.755812,0,include,17,,include,12,,0,include

1239,N,IS THE PRODUCTION AND USE OF GREY MARINE LITERATURE A MODEL FOR OPEN SCIENCE?,"","GLOBALLY, GREY LITERATURE IS COMMON. LARGE QUANTITIES OF OPENLY AVAILABLE GREY LITERATURE HAVE BEEN GENERATED SINCE THE LATTER HALF OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY. IT IS A PRIMARY SOURCE OF INFORMATION USED IN MANY PUBLIC POLICY AND DECISION-MAKING CONTEXTS, AT ALL JURISDICTIONAL LEVELS. IN FACT, PUBLIC DECISION MAKING AND POLICY DEVELOPMENT WOULD SERIOUSLY FALTER TODAY IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH LITERATURE. MOREOVER, IN SOME JURISDICTIONS, LEGISLATION MANDATES TRANSPARENT GOVERNANCE PROCESSES IN WHICH CURRENT RESEARCH MUST BE FULLY OPEN. THIS LENGTHY EXPERIENCE WITH OPEN PRACTICES IN THE PRODUCTION AND USE OF GREY LITERATURE OFFERS INSIGHTS TO THE OPEN SCIENCE MOVEMENT. IN THIS PAPER, BASED ON OVER FIFTEEN YEARS OF INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH, WE DEMONSTRATE HOW OPEN PRACTICES IN THE PRODUCTION AND USE OF GREY LITERATURE IN MARINE ENVIRONMENT SCIENCE POLICY CONTEXTS COULD INFORM OPEN SCIENCE INITIATIVES. THE RESULTS FROM OUR NUMEROUS CASE STUDIES ABOUT INFORMATION USE IN DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES, AT LOCAL TO GLOBAL LEVELS, ADDRESS TWO CONFERENCE THEMES, NAMELY, THE APPLICATION OF OPEN SCIENCE PRINCIPLES IN PROMOTING GREY LITERATURE, AND OBSTACLES AND CHALLENGES TO SUCH OPEN ACCESS. INFORMATION PATHWAYS IN COASTAL AND OCEAN MANAGEMENT ARE COMPLEX AND INVOLVE MANY ACTORS (INCLUDING RESEARCHERS; MANAGERS; POLICY ANALYSTS; MEMBERS OF INDUSTRY, PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS, COMMUNITY GROUPS, AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS; POLITICIANS; AND CITIZENS GENERALLY). OPEN GREY LITERATURE OFFERS NUMEROUS ADVANTAGES IN THESE SETTINGS, AS AN EXTENSIVE VARIETY OF INFORMATION NEEDS, TYPES, AND FORMATS ARE PREVALENT. OPEN GREY LITERATURE CAN ALSO BE DISTRIBUTED WITHOUT RESTRICTION BY INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS. IT CAN NOW BE SHARED GLOBALLY WITH EASE, WHICH IS PARTICULARLY BENEFICIAL TO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES OFTEN UNABLE TO AFFORD COMMERCIAL INFORMATION SOURCES. HOWEVER, WHILE PRODUCED AND USED WIDELY, GREY LITERATURE ALSO PRESENTS CHALLENGES THAT OPEN SCIENCE ALSO ENCOUNTERS. OPENNESS, I.E., OPEN ACCESS, DOES NOT ENSURE AWARENESS AND IT DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY EQUATE TO USABILITY BY A WIDE VARIETY OF AUDIENCES. BECAUSE GREY LITERATURE IS ASSUMED TO BE LARGELY ACCESSIBLE, OFTEN LIMITED ATTENTION IS FOCUSED ON PROMOTING AWARENESS OR COMMUNICATING INFORMATION IN BROADLY UNDERSTANDABLE TERMS. FURTHERMORE, THE MASSIVE QUANTITY OF LITERATURE CAN CONTRIBUTE TO ITS SEEMING INVISIBILITY. THE MULTIPLICITY OF FORMATS AND CONTENT CAN RESULT IN PERCEPTIONS OF LIMITED VALUE OF GREY LITERATURE. EVEN THOUGH THE INFORMATION MAY BE RIGOROUSLY PEER-REVIEWED, IN TODAY'S INFORMATION-SATURATED ENVIRONMENT, OPEN-ACCESS MAY BE EQUATED WITH UNCERTAIN QUALITY. OUR RESEARCH ON THE USE AND INFLUENCE OF GREY LITERATURE IN MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL DECISION MAKING HIGHLIGHTS THE BENEFITS AND CHALLENGES OF OPEN ACCESS INFORMATION.

IN RECENT YEARS, SUBJECT-BASED AND INSTITUTIONAL REPOSITORIES AND DATA CENTRES HAVE EMERGED ALONG WITH ONLINE PUBLISHING. MANY SCIENTIFIC RECORDS, INCLUDING PUBLISHED ARTICLES AND DATA, HAVE BEEN MADE AVAILABLE VIA NEW PLATFORMS. IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, MOST MAJOR RESEARCH FUNDERS HAD A DATA POLICY AND REQUIRE RESEARCHERS TO INCLUDE A `DATA-SHARING PLAN' WHEN APPLYING FOR FUNDING. HOWEVER, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF BARRIERS TO THE FULL-SCALE ADOPTION OF DATA SHARING. THOSE BARRIERS ARE NOT ONLY TECHNICAL, BUT ALSO PSYCHOLOGICAL AND SOCIAL. A SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED WITH OVER 1800 UK-BASED ACADEMICS TO EXPLORE THE EXTENT OF SUPPORT OF DATA SHARING AND THE CHARACTERISTICS AND FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH DATA-SHARING PRACTICE. IT FOUND THAT WHILE MOST ACADEMICS RECOGNISED THE IMPORTANCE OF SHARING RESEARCH DATA, MOST OF THEM HAD NEVER SHARED OR REUSED RESEARCH DATA. THERE WERE DIFFERENCES IN THE EXTENT OF DATA SHARING BETWEEN DIFFERENT GENDER, ACADEMIC DISCIPLINES, AGE AND SENIORITY. IT ALSO FOUND THAT THE AWARENESS OF RESEARCH COUNCIL UK'S (RCUK) OPEN-ACCESS (OA) POLICY, EXPERIENCE OF GOLD AND GREEN OA PUBLISHING, ATTITUDES TOWARDS THE IMPORTANCE OF DATA SHARING AND EXPERIENCE OF USING SECONDARY DATA WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRACTICE OF DATA SHARING.

MULTIPLE ECOSYSTEM TYPES WILL BE IMPACTED ACROSS A RANGE OF INTERACTING SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL SCALES. THE ABILITY OF ECOLOGISTS TO UNDERSTAND AND PREDICT THESE DYNAMICS DEPENDS, IN LARGE PART, ON EXISTING SITE-BASED RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURES DEVELOPED IN RESPONSE TO HISTORIC EVENTS. HERE WE REVIEW HOW UNEVENLY PREPARED ECOLOGISTS ARE, AND MORE GENERALLY, ECOLOGY IS AS A DISCIPLINE, TO ADDRESS REGIONAL- TO CONTINENTAL-SCALE QUESTIONS GIVEN THESE PRE-EXISTING SITE-BASED CAPACITIES, AND WE DESCRIBE THE CHANGES THAT WILL BE NEEDED TO PURSUE THESE BROAD-SCALE QUESTIONS IN THE FUTURE. WE FIRST REVIEW THE TYPES OF APPROACHES COMMONLY USED TO ADDRESS QUESTIONS AT BROAD SCALES, AND IDENTIFY THE RESEARCH, CYBER-INFRASTRUCTURE, AND CULTURAL CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH THESE APPROACHES. THESE CHALLENGES INCLUDE DEVELOPING A MECHANISTIC UNDERSTANDING OF THE DRIVERS AND RESPONSES OF ECOSYSTEM DYNAMICS ACROSS A LARGE, DIVERSE GEOGRAPHIC EXTENT WHERE MEASUREMENTS OF FLUXES OR FLOWS OF MATERIALS, ENERGY OR INFORMATION ACROSS LEVELS OF BIOLOGICAL ORGANIZATION OR SPATIAL UNITS ARE NEEDED. THE DIVERSITY OF METHODS, SAMPLING PROTOCOLS, AND DATA ACQUISITION TECHNOLOGIES MAKE POST-HOC COMPARISONS OF ECOSYSTEMS CHALLENGING, AND DATA COLLECTED USING STANDARDIZED METHODS ACROSS SITES REQUIRE COORDINATION AND TEAMWORK. SHARING OF DATA AND ANALYTICS TO CREATE DERIVED DATA PRODUCTS ARE NEEDED FOR MULTI-SITE STUDIES, BUT THIS LEVEL OF COLLABORATION IS NOT PART OF THE CURRENT ECOLOGICAL CULTURE. WE THEN DISCUSS THE STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF CURRENT SITE-BASED RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURES IN MEETING THESE CHALLENGES, AND DESCRIBE A PATH FORWARD FOR REGIONAL- TO CONTINENTAL-SCALE ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH THAT INTEGRATES EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURES WITH EMERGING AND POTENTIALLY NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO MORE EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS BROAD-SCALE QUESTIONS. THIS NEW RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE WILL BE INSTRUMENTAL IN DEVELOPING AN ``UBER NETWORK'' TO ALLOW USERS TO SEAMLESSLY IDENTIFY AND SELECT, ANALYZE, AND INTERPRET DATA FROM SITES REGARDLESS OF NETWORK AFFILIATION, FUNDING AGENCY, OR POLITICAL AFFINITY, TO COVER THE SPATIAL VARIABILITY AND EXTENT OF REGIONAL- TO CONTINENTAL-SCALE QUESTIONS.

DUE TO THE SUBJECTIVITY AND TIME REQUIREMENTS IN MANUAL MEASUREMENT OF CORTICAL THICKNESS, SCIENTISTS HAVE RELIED ON ROBUST SOFTWARE TOOLS FOR AUTOMATION WHICH FACILITATE THE TESTING AND REFINEMENT OF NEUROSCIENTIFIC HYPOTHESES. THE MOST WIDELY USED TOOL FOR CORTICAL THICKNESS STUDIES IS THE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE, SURFACE-BASED FREESURFER PACKAGE. CRITICAL TO THE ADOPTION OF SUCH TOOLS IS A DEMONSTRATION OF THEIR REPRODUCIBILITY, VALIDITY, AND THE DOCUMENTATION OF SPECIFIC IMPLEMENTATIONS THAT ARE ROBUST ACROSS LARGE, DIVERSE IMAGING DATASETS. TO THIS END, WE HAVE DEVELOPED THE AUTOMATED, VOLUME-BASED ADVANCED NORMALIZATION TOOLS (ANTS) CORTICAL THICKNESS PIPELINE COMPRISING WELL-VETTED COMPONENTS SUCH AS SYGN (MULTIVARIATE TEMPLATE CONSTRUCTION), SYN (IMAGE REGISTRATION), N4 (BIAS CORRECTION), ATROPOS (N-TISSUE SEGMENTATION), AND DIRECT (CORTICAL THICKNESS ESTIMATION). IN THIS WORK, WE HAVE CONDUCTED THE LARGEST EVALUATION OF AUTOMATED CORTICAL THICKNESS MEASURES IN PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATA, COMPARING FREESURFER AND ANTS MEASURES COMPUTED ON 1205 IMAGES FROM FOUR OPEN DATA SETS (IXI, MMRR, NKI, AND OASIS), WITH PARCELLATION BASED ON THE RECENTLY PROPOSED DESIKAN-KILLIANY-TOURVILLE (DKT) CORTICAL LABELING PROTOCOL. WE FOUND GOOD SCAN RESCAN REPEATABILITY WITH BOTH FREESURFER AND ANTS MEASURES. GIVEN THAT SUCH ASSESSMENTS OF PRECISION DO NOT NECESSARILY REFLECT ACCURACY OR AN ABILITY TO MAKE STATISTICAL INFERENCES, WE FURTHER TESTED THE NEUROBIOLOGICAL VALIDITY OF THESE APPROACHES BY EVALUATING THICKNESS-BASED PREDICTION OF AGE AND GENDER.

AMONG OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND NORTHERN AFRICA, JORDAN IS FACING A NUMBER OF ELECTRICITY RELATED CHALLENGES, SUCH AS A RISING ENERGY DEMAND, HIGH DEPENDENCY ON FOSSIL FUEL IMPORTS AND MANAGEMENT OF LOCAL, FOSSIL AND RENEWABLE RESOURCES. THE PAPER PRESENTS AN ANALYSIS BASED ON AN OPEN SOURCE OPTIMISATION MODELLING APPROACH IDENTIFYING A COST-OPTIMAL EXTENSION OF THE JORDANIAN ELECTRICITY SYSTEM WITH GROWING DEMAND PROJECTIONS UNTIL 2030 UTILISING PUMPED HYDRO ENERGY STORAGE AND DETERMINING THE COSTS OF DIFFERENT CO2 MITIGATION PATHWAYS. THE RESULTS HIGHLIGHT THE LARGE POTENTIAL OF RENEWABLE ENERGY FOR THE COST EFFECTIVE, ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY AND ENERGY INDEPENDENT DEVELOPMENT OF THE JORDANIAN ELECTRICITY SECTOR. A SHARE OF UP TO 50\% RENEWABLE ENERGY CAN BE ACHIEVED WITH ONLY A MINOR INCREASE IN LEVELISED COST OF ELECTRICITY FROM 54.42 TO 57.04 \$/MWH. IN PARTICULAR, A COMBINATION OF PHOTOVOLTAIC AND PUMPED HYDRO STORAGE PROVED TO BE A SUPERIOR SOLUTION COMPARED TO THE EXPANSION OF EXISTING SHALE OIL DEPLOYMENTS DUE TO HIGH COSTS AND CO2 EMISSIONS.

THEREFORE, IT IS CRITICAL TO EXPLORE FACTORS THAT MAY SAFEGUARD WOMEN'S POSITIVE BODY IMAGE. A RECENT STUDY BY HOMAN AND TYLKA (2015) FOUND THAT IN A LARGE SAMPLE (N= 263) OF FEMALE MTURK WORKERS AND UNIVERSITY-AGED WOMEN, BOTH APPEARANCE-CONTINGENT SELF-WORTH AND BODY-BASED SOCIAL COMPARISONS WERE LINKED TO LESS POSITIVE BODY IMAGE, BUT THESE LINKS WERE ATTENUATED IN THE FACE OF HIGH SELF-COMPASSION. THIS RESEARCH, AN INDEPENDENT DIRECT REPLICATION OF THE ORIGINAL STUDY, SUPPORTED THE ORIGINAL FINDINGS. IN A NEW, LARGER SAMPLE (N = 363 FEMALE-IDENTIFIED MTURK WORKERS), SIGNALS WERE DETECTED THAT WERE SIMILAR IN SIZE AND MAGNITUDE TO THE ORIGINAL STUDY. SPECIFICALLY, WHILE APPEARANCE-CONTINGENT SELF-WORTH AND BODY-BASED SOCIAL COMPARISONS WERE NEGATIVELY LINKED TO BODY APPRECIATION, THOSE WHO ENDORSED HIGHER LEVELS OF SELF-COMPASSION REPORTED A MORE POSITIVE BODY IMAGE, EVEN IN THE PRESENCE OF THESE POTENTIAL THREATS.

1301,N,BEST PRACTICES FOR REPORTING INDIVIDUAL IDENTIFICATION USING CAMERA TRAP PHOTOGRAPHS,DATA MANAGEMENT; OPEN SCIENCE; MARK-RECAPTURE; POPULATION MODELING;; WILDLIFE MONITORING; JOURNAL POLICY,"CAMERA TRAPS HAVE BECOME A POPULAR SAMPLING TOOL IN ECOLOGICAL STUDIES. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR STUDIES THAT ESTIMATE POPULATION DENSITIES THROUGH SPATIAL CAPTURE-RECAPTURE MODELS OF SPECIES WITH PHYSICAL TRAITS ALLOWING INDIVIDUAL IDENTIFICATION. HOWEVER, MISIDENTIFICATION IS A POTENTIAL PROBLEM WHEN TRYING TO IDENTIFY INDIVIDUALS FROM PHOTOGRAPHS. RESEARCHERS NEED RIGOROUS METHODS FOR CHECKING AND RECTIFYING ERRORS, HANDLING UNCLASSIFIABLE PHOTOGRAPHS AND RESOLVING INTER-OBSERVER DISCREPANCIES TO PREVENT OR REDUCE MISIDENTIFICATION. THROUGH A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF BOTH TRADITIONAL AND SPATIAL CAPTURE-RECAPTURE STUDIES, WE FOUND THAT FEW STUDIES DESCRIBED THE METHODS USED TO AVOID INDIVIDUAL MISIDENTIFICATION; MOREOVER, MOST STUDIES DID NOT PROVIDE PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE THAT INDIVIDUALS COULD BE RELIABLY DIFFERENTIATED. THIS LACK OF TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY PREVENTS REVIEWERS AND READERS FROM ASSESSING THE RELIABILITY AND ROBUSTNESS OF THE STUDIES, AND FALLS SHORT OF THE STANDARDS OF REPORTING COMPARED TO OTHER FIELDS OF RESEARCH SUCH AS BIOMEDICAL OR GENOMIC RESEARCH. TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM, WE PRESENT AN INDIVIDUAL IDENTIFICATION REPORTING CHECKLIST (IIRC) LISTING MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR REPORTING METHODS AND PHOTOGRAPHIC DATA FOR INDIVIDUAL IDENTIFICATION, WHICH ARE NECESSARY EVIDENCE IN PUBLICATIONS THAT RELY ON ACCURATE INDIVIDUAL IDENTIFICATION FROM CAMERA TRAP PHOTOGRAPHS. BY ADOPTING THE IIRC, RESEARCHERS WILL ENHANCE THE CREDIBILITY OF CAPTURE-RECAPTURE STUDIES, FACILITATE INFORMATION TRANSFER AMONG RESEARCHERS, AND IMPROVE THE PROGRESS OF DOWNSTREAM RESEARCH AND CONSERVATION EFFORTS RELIANT ON ACCURATE PHOTOGRAPHIC IDENTIFICATION. WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT PHOTOGRAPHIC DATA MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH HEIGHTENED POACHING RISKS. HOWEVER, IN THE CONTEXT OF CAPTURE-RECAPTURE STUDIES, WE ARGUE THAT FREQUENTLY PUBLISHED INFORMATION SUCH AS STUDY SITE LOCATIONS AND ABUNDANCE ESTIMATES CARRY MUCH HIGHER RISKS OF POACHING, WHILE THE ADDITIONAL THREATS INCURRED FROM THE INCLUSION OF PHOTOGRAPHIC INFORMATION ARE LIKELY TO BE MARGINAL AND CAN BE MITIGATED.

THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF JERASH POINTS TOWARDS AN EXCEPTIONAL DEGREE OF SELF-SUFFICIENCY IN CRAFT PRODUCTS: WHY? THE PROJECT TEAM IMPLEMENTED A FULL QUANTIFICATION APPROACH DURING EXCAVATION, MANUALLY AND DIGITALLY RECORDING AND COUNTING ALL POTTERY AND OTHER CLASSES OF ARTEFACTS. THIS ENABLED A FULL ANALYSIS OF TRENDS IN PRODUCTION AND USE OF CERAMICS THROUGHOUT THE ARCHAEOLOGICALLY DOCUMENTED HISTORY OF JERASH AND REVEALED THE UNEXPECTED PATTERN OF THE EXTREME DOMINANCE OF LOCAL POTTERY. ARCHAEOLOGISTS FORMULATED A SET OF HYPOTHESES TO EXPLAIN THIS PATTERN, AND WE DEVELOPED AN AGENT-BASED MODEL OF SIMPLE CUSTOMER PREFERENCE DRIVING PRODUCT DISTRIBUTION TO EVALUATE SEVERAL EXPLANATORY FACTORS AND THEIR POTENTIAL INTERACTIONS. OUR SIMULATION RESULTS REVEAL THAT PREFERENCE FOR LOCALLY PRODUCED CERAMICS AT JERASH MIGHT BE A PLAUSIBLE THEORY, BUT ONLY IF ITS INTRINSIC VALUE WAS CONSIDERED RATHER HIGH IN COMPARISON TO OTHER GOODS, OR IF IT WAS PREFERRED BY A MAJORITY OF THE POPULATION, AND THERE WAS A TENDENCY TO FOLLOW THIS MAJORITY PREFERENCE (OR A COMBINATION OF THESE FACTORS). HERE, WE PRESENT A COMPLETE RESEARCH PIPELINE OF A FULL QUANTIFICATION OF CERAMICS, ANALYSIS AND MODELLING APPLICABLE AT ANY ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITE.

A SURVEY ON OPEN ACCESS WITH SCIENTISTS FROM THE FRENCH NATIONAL RESEARCH CENTER (CNRS),OPEN ACCESS; OPEN REPOSITORIES; OA PUBLISHING; OPEN SCIENCE; RESEARCH; MANAGEMENT; SELF-ARCHIVING,"PURPOSE - THIS PAPER AIMS TO PRESENT EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE ON THE OPINION AND BEHAVIOUR OF FRENCH SCIENTISTS (SENIOR MANAGEMENT LEVEL) REGARDING OPEN ACCESS (OA) TO SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THE RESULTS ARE PART OF A NATIONWIDE SURVEY ON SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTATION WITH 432 DIRECTORS OF FRENCH PUBLIC RESEARCH LABORATORIES CONDUCTED BY THE FRENCH NATIONAL RESEARCH CENTER (CNRS) IN 2014. FINDINGS - THE CNRS SENIOR RESEARCH MANAGERS (LABORATORY DIRECTORS) GLOBALLY SHARE THE POSITIVE OPINION TOWARDS OA REVEALED BY OTHER STUDIES WITH RESEARCHERS FROM THE UK, GERMANY, THE USA AND OTHER COUNTRIES. HOWEVER, THEY ARE MORE SUPPORTIVE OF OPEN REPOSITORIES (GREEN ROAD) THAN OF OA JOURNAL PUBLISHING (GOLD). THE RESPONSE PATTERNS REVEAL A GAP BETWEEN GENERALLY POSITIVE OPINIONS ABOUT OA AND LESS SUPPORTIVE BEHAVIOURS, PRINCIPALLY PUBLISHING ARTICLES WITH ARTICLE PROCESSING CHARGES (APCS). A SMALL GROUP OF SENIOR RESEARCH MANAGERS DOES NOT SEEM TO BE INTERESTED IN GREEN OR GOLD OA AND RELUCTANT TO SELF-ARCHIVING AND OA PUBLISHING. SIMILAR TO OTHER STUDIES, THE FRENCH SURVEY CONFIRMS DISCIPLINARY DIFFERENCES, I.E. A STRONGER SUPPORT FOR SELF-ARCHIVING OF RECORDS AND DOCUMENTS IN HAL BY SCIENTISTS FROM MATHEMATICS, PHYSICS AND INFORMATICS THAN FROM BIOLOGY, EARTH SCIENCES AND CHEMISTRY; AND MORE EXPERIENCE AND POSITIVE FEELINGS WITH OA PUBLISHING AND PAYMENT OF APCS IN BIOLOGY THAN IN MATHEMATICS OR IN SOCIAL SCIENCES AND HUMANITIES. DISCIPLINARY DIFFERENCES AND SPECIFIC FRENCH FACTORS ARE DISCUSSED, IN PARTICULAR IN THE CONTEXT OF THE NEW EUROPEAN POLICY IN FAVOUR OF OPEN SCIENCE. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - FOR THE FIRST TIME, A NATIONWIDE SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED WITH THE SENIOR RESEARCH MANAGEMENT LEVEL FROM ALL SCIENTIFIC DISCIPLINES. THE RESPONSE RATE WAS HIGH (> 30 PER CENT), AND THE RESULTS PROVIDE GOOD INSIGHT INTO THE REAL AWARENESS, SUPPORT AND UPTAKE OF OA BY SENIOR RESEARCH MANAGERS WHO PROVIDE BOTH MODELS (EXAMPLES FOR GOOD PRACTICE) AND OPINION LEADERSHIP.","",10.1108/ILDS-06-2016-0023,0,include,25,,include,2,,0,include

ONE OF THESE IS EXCHANGING TICKETS BETWEEN VARIOUS TICKETING SYSTEMS IN USE BY GRID COLLABORATIONS. TICKET SYSTEMS SUCH AS FOOTPRINTS, RT, REMEDY, AND SERVICENOW ALL HAVE DIFFERENT SCHEMA THAT MUST BE ADDRESSED IN ORDER TO PROVIDE A RELIABLE EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION BETWEEN SUPPORT ENTITIES AND USERS IN DIFFERENT GRID ENVIRONMENTS. TO COMBAT THIS PROBLEM, OSG OPERATIONS HAS CREATED A TICKET SYNCHRONIZATION INTERFACE CALLED GOC-TX THAT RELIES ON WEB SERVICES INSTEAD OF ERROR-PRONE EMAIL PARSING METHODS OF THE PAST. SYNCHRONIZING TICKETS BETWEEN DIFFERENT TICKETING SYSTEMS ALLOWS ANY USER OR SUPPORT ENTITY TO WORK ON A TICKET IN THEIR HOME ENVIRONMENT, THUS PROVIDING A FAMILIAR AND COMFORTABLE PLACE TO PROVIDE UPDATES WITHOUT HAVING TO LEARN ANOTHER TICKETING SYSTEM. THE INTERFACE IS BUILT IN A WAY THAT IT IS GENERIC ENOUGH THAT IT CAN BE CUSTOMIZED FOR NEARLY ANY TICKETING SYSTEM WITH A WEB-SERVICE INTERFACE WITH ONLY MINOR CHANGES. THIS ALLOWS US TO BE FLEXIBLE AND RAPIDLY BRING NEW TICKET SYNCHRONIZATION ONLINE. SYNCHRONIZATION CAN BE TRIGGERED BY DIFFERENT METHODS INCLUDING MAIL, WEB SERVICES INTERFACE, AND ACTIVE MESSAGING. GOC-TX CURRENTLY INTERFACES WITH GLOBAL GRID USER SUPPORT (GGUS) FOR WLCG, REMEDY AT BROOKHAVEN NATIONAL LAB (BNL), AND REQUEST TRACKER (RT) AT THE VIRTUAL DATA TOOLKIT (VDT).

THE RDA-WDS DATA PUBLISHING WORKFLOWS GROUP SET OUT TO STUDY THE CURRENT DATA-PUBLISHING WORKFLOW LANDSCAPE ACROSS DISCIPLINES AND INSTITUTIONS. A DIVERSE SET OF WORKFLOWS WERE EXAMINED TO IDENTIFY COMMON COMPONENTS AND STANDARD PRACTICES, INCLUDING BASIC SELF-PUBLISHING SERVICES, INSTITUTIONAL DATA REPOSITORIES, LONG-TERM PROJECTS, CURATED DATA REPOSITORIES, AND JOINT DATA JOURNAL AND REPOSITORY ARRANGEMENTS. THE RESULTS OF THIS EXAMINATION HAVE BEEN USED TO DERIVE A DATA-PUBLISHING REFERENCE MODEL COMPRISING GENERIC COMPONENTS. FROM AN ASSESSMENT OF THE CURRENT DATA-PUBLISHING LANDSCAPE, WE HIGHLIGHT IMPORTANT GAPS AND CHALLENGES TO CONSIDER, ESPECIALLY WHEN DEALING WITH MORE COMPLEX WORKFLOWS AND THEIR INTEGRATION INTO WIDER COMMUNITY FRAMEWORKS. IT IS CLEAR THAT THE DATA-PUBLISHING LANDSCAPE IS VARIED AND DYNAMIC AND THAT THERE ARE IMPORTANT GAPS AND CHALLENGES. THE DIFFERENT COMPONENTS OF A DATA-PUBLISHING SYSTEM NEED TO WORK, TO THE GREATEST EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN A SEAMLESS AND INTEGRATED WAY TO SUPPORT THE EVOLUTION OF COMMONLY UNDERSTOOD AND UTILIZED STANDARDS AND-EVENTUALLY-TO INCREASED REPRODUCIBILITY.

HERE, WE PRESENT AN UNORTHODOX APPROACH TO HYDROLOGICAL MODELLING AND ITS POTENTIAL USE IN LOCAL POLICY MAKING REGARDING URBAN GREENERY. THE APPROACH CONSISTS OF A MINIMALIST FIELD CAMPAIGN TO CHARACTERIZE VEGETATION AND SOIL MOISTURE STATUS COMBINED WITH A NOVEL MODEL CALIBRATION USING FREELY AVAILABLE DATA AND SOFTWARE. DURING MODELLING, WE WERE ABLE TO OBTAIN COEFFICIENTS OF DETERMINATION (R-2) OF 0.66 AND 0.73 FOR PROBE-MEASURED AND SIMULATED SOIL MOISTURE UNDER TREE STAND AND PARK LAWN LAND COVERS RESPECTIVELY. THE RESULTS DEMONSTRATED THAT TREE COVER HAD A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE EFFECT ON THE HYDROLOGICAL REGIME OF THE LOCALITY THROUGH INTERCEPTION, TRANSPIRATION AND EFFECTS ON SOIL MOISTURE. SIMULATIONS SUGGESTED THAT TREE COVER WAS TWICE AS EFFECTIVE AT MITIGATING RUNOFF THAN PARK LAWN AND ALMOST SEVEN TIMES BETTER THAN IMPERVIOUS SURFACES. IN THE CASE OF A POTENTIAL REPLACEMENT OF TREE VEGETATION IN FAVOUR OF PARK LAWN OR IMPERVIOUS SURFACES AN INCREASE IN RUNOFF OF 14\% AND 81\% RESPECTIVELY COULD BE EXPECTED.

THE BEST WAY TO TEST RELIABILITY IS TO PREDICT AN EFFECT BEFORE IT OCCURS. IF WE CAN MANIPULATE THE INDEPENDENT VARIABLES (THE EFFICIENT CAUSES) THAT MAKE IT OCCUR, THEN ABILITY TO PREDICT MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO CONTROL. SUCH CONTROL HELPS TO ISOLATE THE RELEVANT VARIABLES. CONTROL ALSO REFERS TO A COMPARISON CONDITION, CONDUCTED TO SEE WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF WE HAD NOT DEPLOYED THE KEY INGREDIENT OF THE HYPOTHESIS: SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE ONLY ACCRUES WHEN WE COMPARE WHAT HAPPENS IN ONE CONDITION AGAINST WHAT HAPPENS IN ANOTHER. WHEN THE RESULTS OF SUCH COMPARISONS ARE NOT DEFINITIVE, METRICS OF THE DEGREE OF EFFICACY OF THE MANIPULATION ARE REQUIRED. MANY OF THOSE DERIVE FROM STATISTICAL INFERENCE, AND MANY OF THOSE POORLY SERVE THE PURPOSE OF THE CUMULATION OF KNOWLEDGE.

THIS DISCUSSION IS ALSO CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH THE NEED TO IDENTIFY SUSTAINABLE WAYS TO EXPAND THE NATIONAL RESEARCH ENTERPRISE AND TO GENERATE ACTIONABLE RESULTS THAT CAN BE APPLIED TO IMPROVE THE NATION'S HEALTH. THE PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICES OF OPEN SCIENCE OFFER A PROMISING PATH TO ADDRESS BOTH GOALS BY FACILITATING (1) INCREASED TRANSPARENCY OF DATA AND METHODS, WHICH PROMOTES RESEARCH REPRODUCIBILITY AND RIGOR; AND (2) CUMULATIVE EFFICIENCIES WHEREIN RESEARCH TOOLS AND THE OUTPUT OF RESEARCH ARE COMBINED TO ACCELERATE THE DELIVERY OF NEW KNOWLEDGE IN PROXIMAL DOMAINS, THEREBY RESULTING IN GREATER PRODUCTIVITY AND A REDUCTION IN REDUNDANT RESEARCH INVESTMENTS. OBJECTIVES: ACADEMYHEALTH'S ELECTRONIC DATA METHODS (EDM) FORUM IMPLEMENTED A PROOF-OF-CONCEPT OPEN SCIENCE PLATFORM FOR HEALTH RESEARCH CALLED THE COLLABORATIVE INFORMATICS ENVIRONMENT FOR LEARNING ON HEALTH OUTCOMES (CIELO). METHODS: THE EDM FORUM CONDUCTED A USER-CENTERED DESIGN PROCESS TO ELUCIDATE IMPORTANT AND HIGH-LEVEL REQUIREMENTS FOR CREATING AND SUSTAINING AN OPEN SCIENCE PARADIGM.

SDHI BUILDS UPON THE CONCEPT OF HARDWARE (HW) RESOURCE DISAGGREGATION. HW RESOURCE DISAGGREGATION BREAKS TODAY'S PHYSICAL SERVER-ORIENTED MODEL WHERE THE USE OF A PHYSICAL RESOURCE (E.G., PROCESSOR OR MEMORY) IS CONSTRAINED TO A PHYSICAL SERVER'S CHASSIS. SDHI EXTENDS THE DEFINITION OF OF SOFTWARE-DEFINED INFRASTRUCTURES (SDI) AND BRINGS GREATER MODULARITY, FLEXIBILITY, AND EXTENSIBILITY TO CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURES, THUS ALLOWING CLOUD OPERATORS TO EMPLOY RESOURCES MORE EFFICIENTLY AND ALLOWING APPLICATIONS NOT TO BE BOUNDED BY THE PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE'S LAYOUT. THIS PAPER AIMS TO BE AN INITIAL INTRODUCTION TO SDHI AND ITS ASSOCIATED TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENTS. THIS PAPER STARTS WITH AN OVERVIEW OF THE CLOUD DOMAIN AND PUTS INTO PERSPECTIVE SOME OF THE MOST PROMINENT EFFORTS IN THE AREA. THEN, IT PRESENTS A SET OF DIFFERENTIATING USE-CASES THAT SDHI ENABLES. NEXT, WE STATE THE FUNDAMENTALS BEHIND SDI AND SDHI, AND ELABORATE WHY SDHI IS OF GREAT INTEREST TODAY. MOREOVER, IT PROVIDES AN OVERVIEW OF THE FUNCTIONAL ARCHITECTURE OF A CLOUD BUILT ON SDHI, EXPLORING HOW THE IMPACT OF THIS TRANSFORMATION GOES FAR BEYOND THE CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE LEVEL IN ITS IMPACT ON PLATFORMS, EXECUTION ENVIRONMENTS, AND APPLICATIONS.

CONECT-E (WWW.CONECTE.ES) IS AN ONLINE PLATFORM WHERE CITIZENS CAN DOCUMENT KNOWLEDGE AND USES OF WILD AND DOMESTICATED SPECIES. WE DESCRIBE THE EXTENT OF THESE INITIATIVES IN TERMS OF PARTICIPATION AND ACCOMPLISHMENT, AND DISCUSS THEIR COMPLEMENTARITIES AND CHALLENGES. RESULTS: THE INITIATIVES DESCRIBED HAVE FOSTERED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A COMMON STANDARD FOR ORGANIZING TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE IN DATABASES THAT FACILITATE KNOWLEDGE DOCUMENTATION: 131,066 USES AND 152,246 LOCAL NAMES HAVE BEEN DOCUMENTED SO FAR. USING OPEN DATA AND COPYLEFT LICENSES, THESE INITIATIVES ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO THE MAINTENANCE OF TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE IN THE COMMONS DOMAIN, GUARANTEEING THE FREE EXCHANGE AND REPRODUCTION OF KNOWLEDGE. HOWEVER, THE EXTENSIVE FOCUS OF THESE INITIATIVES ON DATA SHARING DOES NOT NECESSARILY GUARANTEE KNOWLEDGE HOLDERS' DATA SOVEREIGNTY.

IN THIS CONTEXT, THE ACHIEVEMENT OF A ROBUST, EFFECTIVE AND RESPONSIBLE FORM OF DATA SHARING IS NOW WIDELY ACKNOWLEDGED AS A FUNDAMENTAL PART OF THE RESEARCH PROCESS. THE PRODUCTION AND RESOLUTION OF HUMAN GENOMIC DATA HAS STEADILY INCREASED IN RECENT YEARS, MAINLY DUE TO TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES AND DECREASING COSTS OF DNA GENOTYPING AND SEQUENCING. THERE IS, HOWEVER, A DOWNSIDE TO THIS PROCESS DUE TO THE HUGE INCREASE IN THE COMPLEXITY OF THE DATA AND RELATED METADATA. THIS MEANS IT IS ADVISABLE TO GO BEYOND TRADITIONAL FORMS OF SHARING ANALYSIS, WHICH HAVE FOCUSED ON DATA AVAILABILITY ONLY. HERE WE PRESENT A PILOT STUDY THAT AIMS TO COMPLEMENT A SURVEY ON THE AVAILABILITY OF DATA RELATED TO PEER-REVIEWED PUBLICATIONS WITH AN ANALYSIS OF THEIR FINDABILITY, ACCESSIBILITY, USEABILITY AND ASSESSABILITY (ACCORDING TO THE ``INTELLIGENT DATA OPENNESS'' SCHEME). SHARING RATES IN GENOMIC ANTHROPOLOGY (73.0\%) WERE FOUND TO BE HIGHER THAN HUMAN GENOMICS (32.4\%), BUT LOWER THAN CLOSELY RELATED RESEARCH FIELDS (FROM 96.8\% TO 79.2\% FOR PALEOGENETICS AND EVOLUTIONARY GENETICS, RESPECTIVELY). WE DISCUSS THE PRIVACY AND METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES THAT COULD BE LINKED TO THIS FINDING. COMPARISONS OF SHARING RATES ACROSS A WIDE RANGE OF DISCIPLINES HAS SUGGESTED THAT THE IDEA OF HUMAN GENOMICS AS A FORERUNNER FOR THE OPEN DATA MOVEMENT SHOULD BE QUESTIONED.

THE ESTIMATED SHARING RATE WAS NOT FAR FROM TOTALITY (97.6\% +/- 2.1\%) AND SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER THAN OBSERVED IN OTHER FIELDS OF GENETIC RESEARCH (EVOLUTIONARY, MEDICAL AND FORENSIC GENETICS). BOTH A QUESTIONNAIRE-BASED SURVEY AND THE EXAMINATION OF JOURNALS' EDITORIAL POLICIES SUGGEST THAT THIS HIGH SHARING RATE CANNOT BE SIMPLY EXPLAINED BY THE NEED TO COMPLY WITH STAKEHOLDERS REQUESTS. MOST DATA WERE MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH BODY TEXT, BUT THE USE OF PRIMARY DATABASES INCREASED IN COINCIDENCE WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF COMPLETE MITOCHONDRIAL AND NEXT-GENERATION SEQUENCING METHODS.

MULTIPLE ALGORITHMS FOR THE AUTOMATED MAPPING OF FOREST DISTURBANCE USING REMOTELY SENSED IMAGERY HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED AND APPLIED; HOWEVER, VARIABILITY IN NATURAL AND ANTHROPOGENIC DISTURBANCE PHENOMENA, AS WELL AS IMAGE ACQUISITION CONDITIONS, CAN RESULT IN MAPS THAT MAY BE INCOMPLETE OR THAT CONTAIN INACCURACIES THAT PREVENT THEIR USE FOR DIRECTLY ESTIMATING AREAS OF DISTURBANCE. TO REDUCE ERRORS IN REPORTING DISTURBANCE AREAS, STRATIFIED ESTIMATORS CAN BE APPLIED TO OBTAIN STATISTICALLY ROBUST AREA ESTIMATES, WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY CIRCUMVENTING THE NEED TO CONDUCT A COMPLETE CENSUS OR IN SITUATIONS WHERE SUCH A CENSUS MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE. WE PRESENT A SEMI-AUTOMATED PROCEDURE FOR IMPLEMENTATION IN GOOGLE EARTH ENGINE, 3I3D-GEE, FOR REGIONAL TO GLOBAL MAPPING OF FOREST DISTURBANCE (INCLUDING CLEAR-CUT HARVESTING, FIRE, AND WIND DAMAGE) AND SAMPLE-BASED ESTIMATION OF RELATED AREAS USING DATA FROM THE PROCESSING CAPACITY OF GOOGLE EARTH ENGINE. DOCUMENTATION FOR THE APPLICATION IS ALSO PROVIDED IN APPENDIX A. USING SENTINEL-2 (52) IMAGERY, OUR PROCEDURE WAS APPLIED AND TESTED FOR 2018 IN ITALY FOR WHICH THE APPROXIMATELY 11 MILLION HA OF FORESTS (MOSTLY Q. PUBESCENS, Q. ROBUR, Q. CERRIS, Q. PETRAEA, AND FAGUS SYLVATICA) SERVE AS AN APPROPRIATE CASE STUDY BECAUSE NATIONAL STATISTICS ON FOREST DISTURBANCE AREAS ARE NOT AVAILABLE. TO DECREASE THE OVERALL STANDARD ERRORS OF THE AREA ESTIMATES, THE SAMPLING INTENSITIES IN AREAS WHERE GREATER VARIABILITY IN THE FORM OF GREATER COMMISSION AND OMISSION ERRORS ARE EXPECTED CAN BE INCREASED. TO THIS END, WE AUGMENTED THE PREDICTED FOREST DISTURBANCE MAP WITH A BUFFER CLASS CONSISTING OF A TWO-PIXEL BUFFER (20 M) ON EACH SIDE OF THE DISTURBANCE CLASS BOUNDARY. WE SELECTED A REFERENCE SAMPLE OF 19,300 POINTS: A SIMPLE RANDOM SAMPLE OF 9,300 POINTS FROM THE BUFFER AND SIMPLE RANDOM SAMPLES OF 5000 FROM EACH OF THE UNDISTURBED AND DISTURBED CLASSES. THE REFERENCE SAMPLE WAS PHOTOINTERPRETED USING FINE RESOLUTION ORTHOPHOTOS (30 CM) AND 52 IMAGERY. WHILE THE ESTIMATE OF THE DISTURBED AREA OBTAINED BY ADDING THE AREAS OF PIXELS CLASSIFIED AS DISTURBED WAS 41,732 HA, THE ESTIMATE OBTAINED USING THE UNBIASED STRATIFIED ESTIMATOR WAS 27\% GREATER AT 57,717 +/- 716 HA. REGARDING MAP ACCURACY, WE FOUND SEVERAL OMISSION ERRORS IN THE BUFFER (53.4\%) BUT NONE (0\%) IN THE UNDISTURBED MAP CLASS. SIMILARLY, AMONG THE 1035 COMMISSION ERRORS, THE MAJORITY (744) WERE IN THE BUFFER CLASS. THE METHODS PRESENTED HEREIN PROVIDE A USEFUL TOOL THAT CAN BE USED TO ESTIMATE AREAS OF FOREST DISTURBANCE, WHICH MANY NATIONS MUST REPORT AS PART OF THEIR COMMITMENT TO INTERNATIONAL CONVENTIONS AND TREATIES.

THE INVESTIGATION IS NOVEL, ASSISTING IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF OPEN SCIENCE INFRASTRUCTURE THROUGH ITS SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS OF THE POTENTIAL INTEREST IN, AND VIABILITY OF A BIOMEDICAL REPOSITORY FOR MANAGING OPENLY ACCESSIBLE RESEARCH OUTPUTS FOR THE AUSTRALASIA REGION. THE RESEARCH ADOPTED A QUALITATIVE APPROACH BASED ON SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS AND A FOCUS GROUP. FORTY-FOUR STAKEHOLDERS LOCATED THROUGHOUT AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND PARTICIPATED IN THE RESEARCH. PARTICIPANTS EXPANDED UPON THEIR EXPERIENCE OF PUBMED, MEDLINE, PMC AND THEIR USE OF INFORMATION RESOURCES FOR RESEARCH AND CLINICAL PRACTICE. THE EVIDENCE BASED HEALTHCARE (EBHC) PYRAMID WAS THE THEORETICAL MODEL ADOPTED TO EXPLAIN OPEN BIOMEDICAL REPOSITORY PROCESSES. A STRENGTHS, WEAKNESSES, OPPORTUNITIES AND THREATS (SWOT) ANALYSIS IDENTIFIED SUPPORT FOR EXPLORING MEMBERSHIP OF AN INTERNATIONAL PMC SYSTEM, IN PARTICULAR EUROPE PMC. LESSONS LEARNT FROM PMC US, EUROPE PMC AND PMC CANADA (COLLECTIVELY KNOWN AS PUBMED CENTRAL INTERNATIONAL) INFORMED THE INVESTIGATION. A MAJOR STRENGTH IDENTIFIED WAS THAT PUBMED CENTRAL INTERNATIONAL HAS BEEN ABLE TO ACHIEVE HIGH LEVELS OF COMPLIANCE WAY BEYOND THAT OF MOST INSTITUTIONAL REPOSITORIES. A GREAT THREAT FACED IS OVERCOMING THE DIFFICULTIES OF WORKING TOGETHER WITH OTHER MAJOR WORLD BODIES AND FINANCIALLY SUSTAINING AN AUSTRALASIA PMC. IMPROVING AUSTRALASIAN BIOMEDICAL KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT PROCESSES MAY BE POSSIBLE FROM ADOPTING A PMC FOR RETRIEVING AND TRANSFERRING RESEARCH, LINKED TO THE DATA UNDERLYING THE RESEARCH. THIS IN TURN COULD HELP PUT REGIONAL RESEARCH UNDER A BRIGHTER SPOTLIGHT, POTENTIALLY LEADING TO IMPROVEMENTS IN RESEARCH QUALITY. THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR A POTENTIAL AUSTRALASIA PMC TO HARVEST BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH FROM THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OF AUSTRALIA'S AGGREGATOR DATABASE, TROVE AND WORK CLOSELY WITH EUROPE PMC TO AVOID DUPLICATION OF EFFORT. OVERALL, ESTABLISHMENT OF AN AUSTRALASIA PERMANENT BIOMEDICAL DIGITAL OPEN REPOSITORY IS PERCEIVED AS IMPORTANT, WITH SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL FLOW-ON BENEFITS TO HEALTHCARE, INDUSTRY AND SOCIETY.",OPEN-ACCESS; REPOSITORIES,10.1371/journal.pone.0212843,0,include,39,,include,36,,0,include

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: WE RE-ANNOTATE, A SECOND TIME, THE CONTRIBUTIONS-PERTINENT INFORMATION ACROSS 50 PRIOR-ANNOTATED NLP SCHOLARLY ARTICLES IN TERMS OF A DATA PIPELINE COMPRISING: CONTRIBUTION-CENTERED SENTENCES, PHRASES, AND TRIPLE STATEMENTS. TO THIS END, SPECIFICALLY, CARE WAS TAKEN IN THE ADJUDICATION ANNOTATION STAGE TO REDUCE ANNOTATION NOISE WHILE FORMULATING THE GUIDELINES FOR OUR PROPOSED NOVEL NLP CONTRIBUTIONS STRUCTURING AND GRAPHING SCHEME. FINDINGS: THE APPLICATION OF NLPCONIRIBUTIONGRAPH ON THE 50 ARTICLES RESULTED FINALLY IN A DATASET OF 900 CONTRIBUTION-FOCUSED SENTENCES, 4,702 CONTRIBUTION-INFORMATION-CENTERED PHRASES, AND 2,980 SURFACE-STRUCTURED TRIPLES. THE INFRA-ANNOTATION AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE FIRST AND SECOND STAGES, IN TERMS OF FL-SCORE, WAS 67.92\% FOR SENTENCES, 41.82\% FOR PHRASES, AND 22.31\% FOR TRIPLE STATEMENTS INDICATING THAT WITH INCREASED GRANULARITY OF THE INFORMATION, THE ANNOTATION DECISION VARIANCE IS GREATER. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS: NI.PCONTRIBIMONGRAPH HAS LIMITED SCOPE FOR STRUCTURING SCHOLARLY CONTRIBUTIONS COMPARED WITH STEM (SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING, AND MEDICINE) SCHOLARLY KNOWLEDGE AT LARGE. FURTHER, THE ANNOTATION SCHEME IN THIS WORK IS DESIGNED BY ONLY AN INTRA-ANNOTATOR CONSENSUS-A SINGLE ANNOTATOR FIRST ANNOTATED THE DATA TO PROPOSE THE INITIAL SCHEME, FOLLOWING WHICH, THE SAME ANNOTATOR REANNOTATED THE DATA TO NORMALIZE THE ANNOTATIONS IN AN ADJUDICATION STAGE. HOWEVER, THE EXPECTED GOAL OF THIS WORK IS TO ACHIEVE A STANDARDIZED RETROSPECTIVE MODEL OF CAPTURING NLP CONTRIBUTIONS FROM SCHOLARLY ARTICLES. THIS WOULD ENTAIL A LARGER INITIATIVE OF ENLISTING MULTIPLE ANNOTATORS TO ACCOMMODATE DIFFERENT WORLDVIEWS INTO A ``SINGLE'' SET OF STRUCTURES AND RELATIONSHIPS AS THE FINAL SCHEME. GIVEN THAT THE INITIAL SCHEME IS FIRST PROPOSED AND THE COMPLEXITY OF THE ANNOTATION TASK IN THE REALISTIC TIMEFRAME, OUR INTRA-ANNOTATION PROCEDURE IS WELL-SUITED. NEVERTHELESS, THE MODEL PROPOSED IN THIS WORK IS PRESENTLY LIMITED SINCE IT DOES NOT INCORPORATE MULTIPLE ANNOTATOR WORLDVIEWS. THIS IS PLANNED AS FUTURE WORK TO PRODUCE A ROBUST MODEL. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: WE DEMONSTRATE NLPCONTRIBUTIONGRAPII DATA INTEGRATED INTO THE OPEN RESEARCH KNOWLEDGE GRAPH (ORKG), A NEXT-GENERATION KG-BASED DIGITAL LIBRARY WITH INTELLIGENT COMPUTATIONS ENABLED OVER STRUCTURED SCHOLARLY KNOWLEDGE, AS A VIABLE AID TO ASSIST RESEARCHERS IN THEIR DAY-TO-DAY TASKS. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: NLPCONIRIBUITONGRAPH IS A NOVEL SCHEME TO ANNOTATE RESEARCH CONTRIBUTIONS FROM NLP ARTICLES AND INTEGRATE THEM IN A KNOWLEDGE GRAPH, WHICH TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE DOES NOT EXIST IN THE COMMUNITY.

OPENING UP DATA IS A RECENT CONCERN FOR POLICY MAKERS AND RESEARCHERS, AS THE BASIS FOR GOOD OPEN SCIENCE PRACTICES. THE COMMON FACTOR UNDERLYING THESE NEW PRACTICES-THE RELEVANCE OF PROMOTING OPEN DATA CIRCULATION AND REUSE-IS MOSTLY A SOCIAL FORM OF KNOWLEDGE SHARING AND CONSTRUCTION. HOWEVER, WHILE DATA SHARING IS BEING STRONGLY PROMOTED BY POLICY MAKING AND IS BECOMING A FREQUENT PRACTICE IN SOME DISCIPLINARY FIELDS, OPEN DATA SHARING IS MUCH LESS DEVELOPED IN SOCIAL SCIENCES AND IN EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH. IN THIS STUDY, PRACTICES OF OD PUBLICATION AND SHARING IN THE FIELD OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY ARE EXPLORED.

WE DEVELOPED AN OPEN BIOMEDICAL KNOWLEDGE GRAPH-BASED SYSTEM TERMED REASONING OVER BIOMEDICAL OBJECTS LINKED IN KNOWLEDGE ORIENTED PATHWAYS (ROBOKOP). ROBOKOP CONSISTS OF BOTH A FRONT-END USER INTERFACE AND A BACK-END KNOWLEDGE GRAPH. THE ROBOKOP USER INTERFACE ALLOWS USERS TO POSIT QUESTIONS AND EXPLORE ANSWER SUBGRAPHS. USERS CAN ALSO POSIT QUESTIONS THROUGH DIRECT CYPHER QUERY OF THE UNDERLYING KNOWLEDGE GRAPH, WHICH CURRENTLY CONTAINS ROUGHLY 6 MILLION NODES OR BIOMEDICAL ENTITIES AND 140 MILLION EDGES OR PREDICATES DESCRIBING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN NODES, DRAWN FROM OVER 30 CURATED DATA SOURCES. OBJECTIVE: WE AIMED TO APPLY ROBOKOP TO SURVEY DATA ON WORKPLACE EXPOSURES AND IMMUNE-MEDIATED DISEASES FROM THE ENVIRONMENTAL POLYMORPHISMS REGISTRY (EPR) WITHIN THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES. METHODS: WE ANALYZED EPR SURVEY DATA AND IDENTIFIED 45 ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN WORKPLACE CHEMICAL EXPOSURES AND IMMUNE-MEDIATED DISEASES, AS SELF-REPORTED BY STUDY PARTICIPANTS (N= 4574), WITH 20 ASSOCIATIONS SIGNIFICANT AT P<.05 AFTER FALSE DISCOVERY RATE CORRECTION. WE THEN USED ROBOKOP TO (1) VALIDATE THE ASSOCIATIONS BY DETERMINING WHETHER PLAUSIBLE CONNECTIONS EXIST WITHIN THE ROBOKOP KNOWLEDGE GRAPH AND (2) PROPOSE BIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS THAT MIGHT EXPLAIN THEM AND SERVE AS HYPOTHESES FOR SUBSEQUENT TESTING. WE HIGHLIGHT THE FOLLOWING THREE EXEMPLAR ASSOCIATIONS: CARBON MONOXIDE-MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS, AMMONIA-ASTHMA, AND ISOPROPANOL-ALLERGIC DISEASE. RESULTS: ROBOKOP SUCCESSFULLY RETURNED ANSWER SETS FOR THREE QUERIES THAT WERE POSED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE DRIVING EXAMPLES. THE ANSWER SETS INCLUDED POTENTIAL INTERMEDIARY GENES, AS WELL AS SUPPORTING EVIDENCE THAT MIGHT EXPLAIN THE OBSERVED ASSOCIATIONS. CONCLUSIONS: WE DEMONSTRATE REAL-WORLD APPLICATION OF ROBOKOP TO GENERATE MECHANISTIC HYPOTHESES FOR ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN WORKPLACE CHEMICAL EXPOSURES AND IMMUNE-MEDIATED DISEASES. WE EXPECT THAT ROBOKOP WILL FIND BROAD APPLICATION ACROSS MANY BIOMEDICAL FIELDS AND OTHER SCIENTIFIC DISCIPLINES DUE TO ITS GENERALIZABILITY, SPEED TO DISCOVERY AND GENERATION OF MECHANISTIC HYPOTHESES, AND OPEN NATURE.",CARBON-MONOXIDE; CELLS,10.2196/26714,1,include,39,,include,36,,0,include

THIS EXPECTATION RECOGNIZES THE ENORMOUS BENEFITS OF DATA COLLECTED AND CREATED FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES BEING MADE AVAILABLE FOR SECONDARY USES, AS OPEN SCIENCE GAINS INCREASING SUPPORT. THIS IS PARTICULARLY SO IN THE CONTEXT OF BIG DATA, ESPECIALLY WHERE HEALTH DATA IS INVOLVED. THERE ARE, HOWEVER, ALSO CHALLENGES RELATING TO THE COLLECTION, STORAGE, AND RE-USE OF RESEARCH DATA. THIS PAPER GIVES A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE LANDSCAPE OF DATA SHARING VIA DATA REPOSITORIES AND DISCUSSES SOME OF THE KEY ETHICAL ISSUES RAISED BY THE SHARING OF HEALTH-RELATED RESEARCH DATA, INCLUDING EXPECTATIONS OF PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY, THE TRANSPARENCY OF REPOSITORY GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES, ACCESS RESTRICTIONS, AS WELL AS DATA OWNERSHIP AND THE FAIR ATTRIBUTION OF CREDIT. TO CONSIDER THESE ISSUES AND THE VALUES THAT ARE PERTINENT, THE PAPER APPLIES THE DELIBERATIVE BALANCING APPROACH ARTICULATED IN THE ETHICS FRAMEWORK FOR BIG DATA IN HEALTH AND RESEARCH (XAFIS ET AL. 2019) TO THE DOMAIN OF OPENNESS IN BIG DATA AND DATA REPOSITORIES.

1474,N,REPLICATION IN FIELD ECOLOGY: IDENTIFYING CHALLENGES AND PROPOSING SOLUTIONS,CONFIDENCE IN SCIENCE; EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN; FIELD ECOLOGY; OPEN SCIENCE;; REPEATABILITY; REPLICATION; REPRODUCIBILITY CRISIS,"1. FIELD ECOLOGY HAS BEEN INCLUDED IN A `REPLICATION CRISIS' THAT EXTENDS ACROSS MANY SCIENTIFIC DISCIPLINES. HOWEVER, THE UNDERLYING CONCEPTS OF REPLICATION, REPRODUCIBILITY AND REPLICABILITY ARE NOT ALWAYS CLEARLY DISTINGUISHED, AND COMPLICATE THE IDENTIFICATION OF BEST PRACTICES. FURTHERMORE, CONDUCTING EXPERIMENTS UNDER THE HIGH VARIABILITY OF NATURAL FIELD CONDITIONS REDUCES THE CAPACITY FOR REPLICATION RELATIVE TO OTHER BIOLOGICAL DISCIPLINES WORKING UNDER CONTROLLED CONDITIONS. FIELD ECOLOGISTS ARE THEREFORE FACING A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE IN ASSESSING THE REPLICABILITY OF THEIR RESEARCH WITH IMPLICATIONS FOR OVERALL CONFIDENCE IN STUDY OUTCOMES. 2. THROUGH A REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE, WE DISCUSS SEVERAL RELATED ASPECTS OF EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN THAT CAN ENHANCE CONFIDENCE IN SCIENTIFIC OUTCOMES. SPECIFICALLY, WE DESCRIBE SAMPLE REPLICATION (REPEAT SAMPLE), WITHIN-STUDY REPLICATION (REPEAT EXPERIMENT) AND BETWEEN-STUDY REPLICATION (REPEAT STUDY) AND HOW EACH CAN BE USED WITHIN FIELD ECOLOGY. SINCE PERFECT BETWEEN-STUDY REPLICATION (I.E. DIRECT REPLICATION) IS GENERALLY NOT POSSIBLE IN FIELD ECOLOGY, WE SUGGEST MORE EXPLICIT USE OF CONCEPTUAL REPLICATION WOULD ENHANCE CONFIDENCE IN SCIENTIFIC OUTCOMES. HOWEVER, SUCH CHANGES REQUIRE CULTURAL SHIFTS IN PRACTICE AMONG ALL PARTICIPANTS IN THE SCIENTIFIC ENTERPRISE. 3. WE SUGGEST SEVERAL TANGIBLE STEPS COULD BE TAKEN TO IMPROVE CONFIDENCE IN ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH: (A) INCREASE THE USE OF WITHIN-STUDY REPLICATION BEFORE PUBLICATION, (B) INCREASE REPLICABILITY FOR ASPECTS THAT WE CAN CONTROL (E.G. PRE-REGISTER EXPERIMENTS, OPEN DATA, PUBLISH CODE), (C) DIVEST FROM NOVELTY AS THE PRIMARY CRITERION FOR PUBLICATION IN LEADING ECOLOGICAL JOURNALS AND INVEST IN EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN, (D) BE SCEPTICAL OF CONTRADICTORY FINDINGS FROM STUDIES TESTING SIMILAR RESEARCH QUESTIONS AND (E) CREATE A PUBLISHING ENVIRONMENT THAT ENCOURAGES MORE CONCEPTUAL REPLICATION STUDIES. 4. WE BELIEVE ADOPTING THESE PRACTICES WILL INCREASE THE CONFIDENCE IN RESULTS FOR FIELD ECOLOGY. THERE ARE CRITICAL OBSTACLES THAT COULD PREVENT SOME SCIENTISTS FROM INCREASING WITHIN-STUDY OR BETWEEN-STUDY REPLICATION, INCLUDING SHORT-TERM FUNDING MECHANISMS AND THE PROSPECT OF FEWER PUBLICATIONS. WE SUGGEST STRATEGIES TO MITIGATE NEGATIVE IMPACTS TO RESEARCHERS, SUCH AS LEADING JOURNALS PILOTING NEW ARTICLE CATEGORIES AND EXPLICIT MENTION OF EXPERIMENTALLY LINKED STUDIES. WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ADOPTING GREATER REPLICATION IN FIELD ECOLOGY WILL REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO CULTURAL PRACTICES, BUT THERE ARE CLEAR BENEFITS FOR IMPROVING OUR CONFIDENCE IN SCIENCE.",BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY; METAANALYSIS; SCIENCE; REPRODUCIBILITY;; PRODUCTIVITY; PSEUDOREPLICATION; TRANSPARENCY; INCENTIVES,10.1111/2041-210X.13657,1,include,29,Avaialble at: https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/2041-210X.13657,include,22,,0,include

CONSEQUENTLY, BURNETTE ET AL. RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT THE USE OF MTURK FOR PSYCHOLOGICAL RESEARCH, PARTICULARLY IN AN EATING DISORDER CONTEXT. HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE THESE CLAIMS ARE OVERSTATED BECAUSE THEY ARISE FROM A SINGLE STUDY NOT DESIGNED TO TEST MTURK DATA QUALITY. FURTHER, DESPITE CLAIMING TO GO ``ABOVE AND BEYOND'' CURRENT RECOMMENDATIONS, BURNETTE ET AL. MISSED KEY SCREENING PROCEDURES. IN PARTICULAR, THEY MISSED PROCEDURES KNOWN TO PREVENT PARTICIPANTS WHO USE COMMERCIAL DATA CENTERS (I.E., SERVER FARMS) TO HIDE THEIR TRUE IP ADDRESS AND COMPLETE MULTIPLE SURVEYS FOR FINANCIAL GAIN. IN THIS COMMENTARY, WE OUTLINE KEY SCREENING PROCEDURES THAT ALLOW RESEARCHERS TO OBTAIN QUALITY MTURK DATA. WE ALSO HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF BALANCING EFFORTS TO INCREASE DATA QUALITY WITH EFFORTS TO MAINTAIN SAMPLE DIVERSITY.

TWO AUTHORS INDEPENDENTLY RECORDED WHETHER A DATA OR CODE AVAILABILITY STATEMENT (OR BOTH) APPEARED IN EACH REVIEW AND CODED THE CONTENT OF THE STATEMENTS USING AN INDUCTIVE APPROACH. RESULTS: OF THE 300 INCLUDED SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS WITH META-ANALYSIS, 86 (29\%) HAD A DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT, AND SEVEN (2\%) HAD BOTH A DATA AND CODE AVAILABILITY STATEMENT. IN 12/93 (13\%) DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENTS, AUTHORS STATED THAT DATA FILES WERE AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOAD FROM THE JOURNAL WEBSITE OR A DATA REPOSITORY, WHICH WE VERIFIED AS BEING TRUE. WHILE 39/93 (42\%) AUTHORS STATED DATA WERE AVAILABLE UPON REQUEST, 37/93 (40\%) IMPLIED THAT SHARING OF DATA FILES WAS NOT NECESSARY OR APPLICABLE TO THEM, MOST OFTEN BECAUSE ``ALL DATA APPEAR IN THE ARTICLE''OR ``NO DATASETS WERE GENERATED OR ANALYZED''. DISCUSSION: DATA AND CODE AVAILABILITY STATEMENTS APPEAR INFREQUENTLY IN SYSTEMATIC REVIEW MANUSCRIPTS. AUTHORS WHO DO PROVIDE A DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT OFTEN INCORRECTLY IMPLY THAT DATA SHARING IS NOT APPLICABLE TO SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS.

FINDINGS: HERE WE PRESENT BIOSPYTIAL, A MODULAR OPEN SOURCE KNOWLEDGE ENGINE DESIGNED TO IMPORT, ORGANISE, ANALYSE AND VISUALISE BIG SPATIAL ECOLOGICAL DATASETS USING THE POWER OF GRAPH THEORY. THE ENGINE USES A HYBRID GRAPH-RELATIONAL APPROACH TO STORE AND ACCESS INFORMATION. A GRAPH DATA STRUCTURE USES LINKAGE RELATIONSHIPS TO BUILD SEMANTIC STRUCTURES REPRESENTED AS COMPLEX DATA STRUCTURES STORED IN A GRAPH DATABASE, WHILE TABULAR AND GEOSPATIAL DATA ARE STORED IN AN EFFICIENT SPATIAL RELATIONAL DATABASE SYSTEM. WE PROVIDE AN APPLICATION USING INFORMATION ON SPECIES OCCURRENCES, THEIR TAXONOMIC CLASSIFICATION AND CLIMATIC DATASETS. WE BUILT A KNOWLEDGE GRAPH OF THE TREE OF LIFE EMBEDDED IN AN ENVIRONMENTAL AND GEOGRAPHICAL GRID TO PERFORM AN ANALYSIS ON THREATENED SPECIES CO-OCCURRING WITH JAGUARS (PANTHERA ONCA). CONCLUSIONS: THE BIOSPYTIAL APPROACH REDUCES THE COMPLEXITY OF JOINING DATASETS USING MULTIPLE TABULAR RELATIONS, WHILE ITS SCALABLE DESIGN EASES THE PROBLEM OF MERGING DATASETS FROM DIFFERENT SOURCES. ITS MODULAR DESIGN MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO DISTRIBUTE SEVERAL INSTANCES SIMULTANEOUSLY, ALLOWING FAST AND EFFICIENT HANDLING OF BIG ECOLOGICAL DATASETS. THE PROVIDED EXAMPLE DEMONSTRATES THE ENGINE'S CAPABILITIES IN PERFORMING BASIC GRAPH MANIPULATION, ANALYSIS AND VISUALIZATIONS OF TAXONOMIC GROUPS CO-OCCURRING IN SPACE.

ACCORDING TO MEDIA REPORTS, MICRODOSING HAS GROWN IN POPULARITY, YET THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE CONTAINS MINIMAL RESEARCH ON THIS PRACTICE. THERE HAS BEEN LIMITED REPORTING ON ADVERSE EVENTS ASSOCIATED WITH MICRODOSING, AND THE EXPERIENCES OF MICRODOSERS IN COMMUNITY SAMPLES HAVE NOT BEEN CATEGORIZED. METHODS: IN THE PRESENT STUDY, WE DEVELOP A CODEBOOK OF MICRODOSING BENEFITS AND CHALLENGES (MDBC) BASED ON THE QUALITATIVE REPORTS OF A REAL-WORLD SAMPLE OF 278 MICRODOSERS. RESULTS: WE DESCRIBE NOVEL FINDINGS, BOTH IN TERMS OF BENEFICIAL OUTCOMES, SUCH AS IMPROVED MOOD (26.6\%) AND FOCUS (14.8\%), AND IN TERMS OF CHALLENGING OUTCOMES, SUCH AS PHYSIOLOGICAL DISCOMFORT (18.0\%) AND INCREASED ANXIETY (6.7\%).

THE CHALLENGES ARE NOT ONLY ON A TECHNICAL LEVEL BUT ALSO CONNECTED TO SOCIETAL ASPECTS. ENERGY SYSTEM MODELLING PLAYS A DECISIVE ROLE IN THIS FIELD, AND MODEL PROPERTIES DEFINE HOW USEFUL IT IS IN REGARD TO THE EXISTING CHALLENGES. FOR ENERGY SYSTEM MODELS, EVALUATION METHODS EXIST, BUT WE ARGUE THAT MANY DECISIONS UPON PROPERTIES ARE RATHER MADE ON THE MODEL GENERATOR OR FRAMEWORK LEVEL. THUS, THIS PAPER PRESENTS A QUALITATIVE APPROACH TO EVALUATE FRAMEWORKS IN A TRANSPARENT AND STRUCTURED WAY REGARDING THEIR SUITABILITY TO TACKLE ENERGY SYSTEM MODELLING CHALLENGES. CURRENT MAIN CHALLENGES AND FRAMEWORK PROPERTIES THAT POTENTIALLY CONTRIBUTE TO TACKLE THESE CHALLENGES ARE DERIVED FROM A LITERATURE REVIEW.

WE SUGGEST THREE MAJOR PROPERTY CATEGORIES OF FRAMEWORKS WITH REGARD TO THEIR CAPABILITY TO TACKLE THE CHALLENGES: OPEN-SOURCE PHILOSOPHY (1), COLLABORATIVE MODELLING (2), AND STRUCTURAL PROPERTIES (3). GENERAL FINDINGS OF THE DETAILED MAPPING OF CHALLENGES AND PROPERTIES ARE THAT AN OPEN-SOURCE APPROACH IS A PRE-CONDITION FOR COMPLYING WITH SCIENTIFIC STANDARDS AND THAT APPROACHES TO TACKLE THE CHALLENGES COMPLEXITY AND UNCERTAINTY COUNTERACT EACH OTHER. MORE RESEARCH IN THE FIELD OF COMPLEXITY REDUCTION WITHIN ENERGY SYSTEM MODELS IS NEEDED. FURTHERMORE, WHILE FRAMEWORK PROPERTIES CAN SUPPORT TO ADDRESS PROBLEMS OF RESULT COMMUNICATION AND INTERDISCIPLINARY MODELLING, AN IMPORTANT PART CAN ONLY BE ADDRESSED BY COMMUNICATION AND ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURES, THUS, ON A BEHAVIOURAL AND SOCIAL LEVEL.

THE PURPOSE OF THIS INNOVATION WAS TO PROMOTE THE OPEN SHARING OF DATA WITHIN AND ACROSS ORGANIZATIONAL LINES AND ACROSS GEOGRAPHIC DISTANCES. AS THE USE OF THE SYSTEM CONTINUED, END USERS AND GROUP ADMINISTRATORS REQUESTED THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SECOND, INTRANET-BASED SYSTEM WITH SIMILAR FUNCTIONALITY. AFTER THREE YEARS OF OPERATION, A SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED OF USERS OF THE SYSTEM TO UNDERSTAND WHY SOME USERS AND RESEARCH GROUPS APPEARED TO UTILIZE THE TWO SYSTEMS MORE THAN OTHERS. FROM THIS RESEARCH WE FOUND THAT SOME BARRIERS TO USE INCLUDE: (1) MISMATCH OF SYSTEM FUNCTIONALITY TO USER OR GROUP NEEDS; (2) WILLINGNESS TO SHARE WITH AN INTERNAL GROUP BY INTRANET BUT NOT WITH THE WORLD BY INTERNET; AND (3) RESISTANCE TO ENTERING METADATA BECAUSE OF WORKPLACE HABITS. THIS EXPERIENCE HAS ALSO TAUGHT US THAT WITH RESPECT TO WEB-BASED METADATA AND DATA REPOSITORIES THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LONG-TERM AND SHORT-TERM RESEARCH PROJECTS IN THEIR NEED TO ESTABLISH GOOD METADATA AND DATA STORAGE PROCEDURES. MOREOVER, SOME TIME IS REQUIRED FOR RESEARCHERS TO CHANGE FROM SHORT-TERM TO LONG-TERM PROJECT THINKING.

CURRENTLY, THE MAJOR CHALLENGE IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF AUTONOMOUS OPERATIONS TO COMPLETE MISSIONS AND REPLACE HUMAN OPERATORS. IN THIS PAPER, BASED ON THE TYPE OF ANALYZING VIDEOS AND IMAGES CAPTURED BY DRONES IN COMPUTER VISION, WE HAVE REVIEWED THESE APPLICATIONS BY CATEGORIZING THEM INTO THREE GROUPS. THE FIRST GROUP IS RELATED TO REMOTE SENSING WITH CHALLENGES SUCH AS CAMERA CALIBRATION, IMAGE MATCHING, AND AERIAL TRIANGULATION. THE SECOND GROUP IS RELATED TO DRONE-AUTONOMOUS NAVIGATION, IN WHICH COMPUTER VISION METHODS ARE DESIGNED TO EXPLORE CHALLENGES SUCH AS FLIGHT CONTROL, VISUAL LOCALIZATION AND MAPPING, AND TARGET TRACKING AND OBSTACLE DETECTION. THE THIRD GROUP IS DEDICATED TO USING IMAGES AND VIDEOS CAPTURED BY DRONES IN VARIOUS APPLICATIONS, SUCH AS SURVEILLANCE, AGRICULTURE AND FORESTRY, ANIMAL DETECTION, DISASTER DETECTION, AND FACE RECOGNITION. SINCE MOST OF THE COMPUTER VISION METHODS RELATED TO THE THREE CATEGORIES HAVE BEEN DESIGNED FOR REAL-WORLD CONDITIONS, PROVIDING REAL CONDITIONS BASED ON DRONES IS IMPOSSIBLE.

MULTIDISCIPLINARITY IS GENERALLY THE MOST APPROPRIATE WORD TO USE TO CHARACTERIZE THE CENTRE'S RESEARCH. INTERDISCIPLINARITY WAS UNFOLDED WITHIN THE SIX RESEARCH PROJECTS, RESULTING IN A BOOK ON FIVE INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH ISSUES INVOLVING SELECTED RESEARCHERS. THE RESEARCH CENTRE WAS STRATEGIC, INVOLVING GOVERNMENTAL RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS AND MUSEUMS, AND IN ADDITION BACKGROUND GROUPS WERE ESTABLISHED WITH RESEARCHERS, ADMINISTRATORS, LANDOWNERS AND ORGANIZATIONS, BUT ON THIS BASIS NO REAL TRANSDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH WAS MADE. THE CENTRE WAS A SUCCESS BECAUSE ALL MULTIDISCIPLINARY GOALS WERE REACHED AND INTERDISCIPLINARITY WAS REACHED AT A CERTAIN LEVEL.

HOWEVER, THE SHIFT TO MORE PLANT-BASED DIETS IS HAMPERED BY CONSUMERS FINDING MEAT-BASED FOODS MORE ATTRACTIVE THAN PLANT-BASED FOODS. HOW CAN PLANT-BASED FOODS BEST BE DESCRIBED TO INCREASE THEIR APPEAL TO CONSUMERS? BASED ON THE GROUNDED COGNITION THEORY OF DESIRE, WE SUGGEST THAT DESCRIPTIONS THAT TRIGGER SIMULATIONS, OR RE-EXPERIENCES, OF EATING AND ENJOYING A FOOD WILL INCREASE THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF A FOOD, COMPARED TO DESCRIPTIONS EMPHASIZING INGREDIENTS. IN STUDY 1, WE FIRST EXAMINED THE DESCRIPTIONS OF READY MEALS AVAILABLE IN FOUR LARGE UK SUPERMARKETS (N = 240). WE FOUND THAT THE LABELS OF MEAT-BASED FOODS CONTAINED MORE REFERENCES TO EATING SIMULATIONS THAN VEGETARIAN FOODS, AND SLIGHTLY MORE THAN PLANT-BASED FOODS, AND THAT THIS VARIED BETWEEN SUPERMARKETS. IN STUDIES 2 AND 3 (N = 170, N = 166, PRE-REGISTERED), WE MANIPULATED THE LABELS OF PLANT-BASED AND MEAT-BASED FOODS TO EITHER INCLUDE EATING SIMULATION WORDS OR NOT.

WHILE HUMAN-ROBOT INTERACTION (HRI) IS AN INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH FIELD, THE STUDY OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR, COGNITION AND EMOTION IN HRI PLAYS ALSO A VITAL PART. ARE HRI USER STUDIES FACING THE SAME PROBLEMS AS OTHER FIELDS AND IF SO, WHAT CAN BE DONE TO OVERCOME THEM? IN THIS ARTICLE, WE FIRST GIVE A SHORT OVERVIEW OF THE REPLICABILITY CRISIS IN BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES AND ITS CAUSES. IN A SECOND STEP, WE ESTIMATE THE REPLICABILITY OF HRI USER STUDIES MAINLY 1) BY STRUCTURAL COMPARISON OF HRI RESEARCH PROCESSES AND PRACTICES WITH THOSE OF OTHER DISCIPLINES WITH REPLICABILITY ISSUES, 2) BY SYSTEMATICALLY REVIEWING META-ANALYSES OF HRI USER STUDIES TO IDENTIFY PARAMETERS THAT ARE KNOWN TO AFFECT REPLICABILITY, AND 3) BY SUMMARIZING FIRST REPLICATION STUDIES IN HRI AS DIRECT EVIDENCE. OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT HRI USER STUDIES OFTEN EXHIBIT THE SAME PROBLEMS THAT CAUSED THE REPLICABILITY CRISIS IN MANY BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES, SUCH AS SMALL SAMPLE SIZES, LACK OF THEORY, OR MISSING INFORMATION IN REPORTED DATA.

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THE GROUNDED THEORY METHODOLOGY WAS ADOPTED. FOR DATA COLLECTION, INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED WITH 13 BRAZILIAN RESEARCHERS INVOLVED WITH THE ZIKA VIRUS THEME. DATA ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED USING THE OPEN, AXIAL AND SELECTIVE CODING PROCESSES, ACCORDING TO THE PRINCIPLES OF THE GROUNDED THEORY. FINDINGS BASED ON DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS, SEVEN THEORETICAL CATEGORIES REPRESENTING INTERVENING FACTORS IN ZIKA VIRUS RESEARCH DATA COMMUNICATION WERE IDENTIFIED. THE EMERGING THEORY SHOWED THE CENTRALITY OF RESEARCHERS' EXPECTATIONS FOR ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND REWARD, INFLUENCED BY THE ASPECTS OF RESEARCH FUNDING AND ACADEMIC CULTURE. THREE FACTORS INVOLVED IN THE MACRO PROCESSES OF RESEARCH DATA COMMUNICATION: DATA USE, DATA PRODUCTION AND DATA SHARING. IN THE USE AND PRODUCTION PROCESSES, FACTORS RELATED TO COLLABORATION FIGURED MOST STRONGLY. IN THE PRODUCTION AND SHARING PROCESSES, THE FACTORS REGARDING DATA PROCESSING AND THE USE OF RESEARCH DATA REPOSITORIES WERE MORE PRONOUNCED. FINALLY, DATA SHARING, AND THE POSSIBILITY OF REUSING DATA ARE DIRECTLY AFFECTED BY THE SOCIAL CONTEXT OF ZIKA VIRUS DISEASE AS AN EMERGING DISEASE. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THE STUDY PRESENTS A THEORY DEVELOPED SYSTEMATICALLY TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON OF COMMUNICATION OF RESEARCH DATA ON ZIKA VIRUS.

THIS MANUSCRIPT REPORTS DIRECT REPLICATIONS OF THREE KEY EXPERIMENTS REPORTED BY OTTATI ET AL. 2015 IN THIS JOURNAL IN SUPPORT OF THE EARNED DOGMATISM HYPOTHESIS. CONSISTENT WITH THE ORIGINAL FINDINGS, IT WAS FOUND THAT DOGMATIC BEHAVIOR IS CONSIDERED SUBSTANTIALLY MORE APPROPRIATE FOR EXPERTS RELATIVE TO NOVICES (D = 0.45 [0.35, 0.55] OVER ALL REPLICATIONS AND ORIGINAL STUDY). IN ADDITION, IT WAS CONFIRMED THAT WHEN PARTICIPANTS ENVISION THEMSELVES AS EXPERTS THEY PREDICT THEY WILL BE MORE CLOSE-MINDED (D = -0.54 [-0.64, -0.44]). UNFORTUNATELY, REPLICATIONS INVOLVING MANIPULATION OF EXPERTISE THROUGH TASK DIFFICULTY SHOWED LITTLE TO NO EFFECT ON OPEN-MINDED COGNITION (D = 0.00 [-0.21, 0.21] FOR EASY/DIFFICULT RECALL TASK; D = -0.02 [-0.21, -0.17] FOR EASY/DIFFICULT TRIVIA TASK). THE BALANCE OF EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT THE EARNED DOGMATISM HYPOTHESIS IS CURRENTLY WELL-SUPPORTED ONLY FOR PROSPECTIVE MANIPULATIONS OF EXPERTISE THAT REQUIRE PARTICIPANTS TO PREDICT THEIR SOCIAL BEHAVIORS.

FOR A SAMPLE OF 6019 RESEARCHERS, WE ANALYZE THE EXTENT/FREQUENCY OF THEIR DATA SHARING. SPECIFICALLY, THE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE FOLLOWING FOUR VARIABLES: HOW MUCH THEY VALUE DATA CITATIONS, THE EXTENT TO WHICH THEIR DATA-SHARING ACTIVITIES ARE FORMALLY RECOGNIZED, THEIR PERCEPTIONS OF WHETHER SUFFICIENT CREDIT IS AWARDED FOR DATA SHARING, AND THE REPORTED EXTENT TO WHICH DATA CITATIONS MOTIVATE THEIR DATA SHARING.

THE TWO OBJECTS HIGH ON THE LIST FOR PERMANENT BASES ARE THE MOON AND MARS. BOTH HAVE BEEN AT THE CENTER OF ATTENTION OF MANY RECENT SPACEFLIGHT ACTIVITIES, ALBEIT THESE HAVE SO FAR BEEN UNCREWED. IF HUMANS INDEED LAND ON EITHER ONE OF THEM, SCIENCE CAN POTENTIALLY BENEFIT TREMENDOUSLY. IN THE PAST, MOST SPACEFLIGHT MISSIONS HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED BY ADDING SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS AFTER MOST OF THE ENGINEERING WORK IS ALREADY FINISHED. THIS HAS OFTEN LIMITED SCIENTIFIC STUDIES TO RELATIVELY SCATTERED, INSULAR TOPICS. HOWEVER, IF PREPARED APPROPRIATELY, A RESEARCH LABORATORY ON EITHER THE MOON OR MARS CAN HELP ADDRESS SCIENTIFIC QUESTIONS THOROUGHLY AND AT A FUNDAMENTAL LEVEL. IN THIS PAPER WE REVIEW THE MAIN SCIENTIFIC QUESTIONS RELATING TO THE MOON THAT ARE STILL OPEN AND DEVELOP AN OVERVIEW OF THE INSTRUMENTATION THAT WOULD BE NECESSARY FOR A HUMAN ASTRONAUT INSIDE A LUNAR LABORATORY TO HELP ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS. OUR PRIMARY FOCUS IS THE MOON, HOWEVER, WE INCLUDE AN OUTLOOK TO MARS, SINCE WE ASSUME THAT THE MOON NOT ONLY PROVIDES A VALUABLE TESTBED FOR MANY TECHNOLOGIES TO BE USED ON MARS, BUT THAT BOTH CAN BE STUDIED WITH THE SAME HABITAT LABORATORY AFTER SOME SPECIFIC ADAPTATIONS. THE RESEARCH AREAS WE FOCUS ON ARE RELATED TO (A) NON-LIVING MATTER (GEOPHYSICS, GEOLOGY, MATERIALS SCIENCE), (B) EXTRATERRESTRIAL LIFE (FROM CHEMISTRY OF ORGANIC CARBON COMPOUNDS TO ASTROBIOLOGY), AND (C) LIFE INSIDE THE HUMAN HABITAT (BIOREGENERATIVE LIFE-SUPPORT SYSTEMS, MICROBIOMES, HUMAN PHYSIOLOGY).

THEREFORE, THIS STUDY PERFORMS A COMPREHENSIVE MODEL COMPARISON OF FIVE MATURE OPEN SOURCE POWER SECTOR MODELS. FOR THIS PURPOSE, WE APPLY EIGHT FULLY HARMONIZED AND SIMPLIFIED ONE-YEAR SCENARIOS FOR THE GERMAN POWER SECTOR, TO ANALYZE DEVIATIONS IN MODEL RESULTS. FIRST, AN IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS OF TWO BASE SCENARIOS FOR 2016 AND 2030 REVEALS THAT LINEAR PROGRAMMING-BASED MODELS DIFFER SUBSTANTIALLY FROM MODELS WITH PRE IMPLEMENTED DISPATCH ORDERS. OTHER DEVIATIONS OCCUR ACROSS ALL MODELS AND ARE MAINLY CAUSED BY THE INDIFFERENT USE OF FLEXIBILITY OPTIONS SUCH AS STORAGE AND TRANSMISSION. SECOND, VARIATIONS OF PARAMETERS AND CHARACTERISTICS WITH A POLITICAL SIGNIFICANCE ARE INDIVIDUALLY APPLIED TO THE 2030 BASE SCENARIO TO IDENTIFY THEIR IMPACT ON MODEL RESULTS. THIS INCLUDES CO(2 )EMISSION BUDGETS, INCREASED DEMANDS BY SECTOR COUPLING, COAL EXIT STRATEGIES, AND RENEWABLE GENERATION SHARES.

META-ANALYSES CAN RESOLVE LONG-STANDING DISPUTES, DISPEL SPURIOUS CLAIMS, AND GENERATE NEW RESEARCH QUESTIONS. AT THEIR WORST, HOWEVER, META-ANALYSIS PUBLICATIONS ARE WOLVES IN SHEEP'S CLOTHING: SUBJECTIVE WITH BIASED CONCLUSIONS, HIDDEN UNDER COATS OF OBJECTIVE AUTHORITY. CONCLUSIONS CAN BE RENDERED UNRELIABLE BY INAPPROPRIATE STATISTICAL METHODS, PROBLEMS WITH THE METHODS USED TO SELECT PRIMARY RESEARCH, OR PROBLEMS WITHIN THE PRIMARY RESEARCH ITSELF. BECAUSE OF THESE RISKS, META-ANALYSES ARE INCREASINGLY CONDUCTED AS PART OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS, WHICH USE STRUCTURED, TRANSPARENT, AND REPRODUCIBLE METHODS TO COLLATE AND SUMMARISE EVIDENCE. FOR READERS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE CONCLUSIONS FROM A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OR META-ANALYSIS SHOULD BE TRUSTED - AND TO BE ABLE TO BUILD UPON THE REVIEW - AUTHORS NEED TO REPORT WHAT THEY DID, WHY THEY DID IT, AND WHAT THEY FOUND. COMPLETE, TRANSPARENT, AND REPRODUCIBLE REPORTING IS MEASURED BY `REPORTING QUALITY'. TO ASSESS PERCEPTIONS AND STANDARDS OF REPORTING QUALITY OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS AND META-ANALYSES PUBLISHED IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY, WE SURVEYED 208 RESEARCHERS WITH RELEVANT EXPERIENCE (AS AUTHORS, REVIEWERS, OR EDITORS), AND CONDUCTED DETAILED EVALUATIONS OF 102 SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS PAPERS PUBLISHED BETWEEN 2010 AND 2019. REPORTING QUALITY WAS FAR BELOW OPTIMAL AND APPROXIMATELY NORMALLY DISTRIBUTED. MEASURED REPORTING QUALITY WAS LOWER THAN WHAT THE COMMUNITY PERCEIVED, PARTICULARLY FOR THE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW METHODS REQUIRED TO MEASURE TRUSTWORTHINESS.

FIRST, ALTHOUGH THE FLOW SOLVES A NONLINEAR PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION (PDE), TOEPFER SUCCESSFULLY COMPUTED HIGHLY ACCURATE NUMERICAL SOLUTIONS IN 1912. HIS SECRET WAS TO COMBINE A RUNGE-KUTTA METHOD FOR INTEGRATING AN ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION (ODE) INITIAL VALUE PROBLEM WITH SOME SYMMETRY PRINCIPLES AND SIMILARITY REDUCTIONS, WHICH COLLAPSE THE PDE SYSTEM TO THE ODE SHOWN ABOVE. THIS SHOWS THAT PDE NUMERICAL STUDIES WERE POSSIBLE EVEN IN THE PRECOMPUTER AGE. THE TRUTH, BOTH A HUNDRED YEARS AGO AND NOW, IS THAT MATHEMATICAL THEOREMS AND INSIGHTS ARE AN ARITHMURGIST'S BEST FRIEND, AND THEY CAN VASTLY REDUCE THE COMPUTATIONAL BURDEN. SECOND, WE SHOW THAT SPECIAL TRICKS, APPLICABLE ONLY TO A GIVEN PROBLEM, CAN BE AS USEFUL AS THE BROAD, GENERAL METHODS THAT ARE THE FABRIC OF MOST APPLIED MATHEMATICS COURSES: THE IMPORTANCE OF ``PARTICULARITY.''

BUILDING ON THIS, RECENT CONCEPTS (E.G., THIRD MISSION) DISCUSS THE ROLE AND VALUE OF DIFFERENT DISSEMINATION MECHANISMS FOR INCREASING SOCIETAL IMPACT. HOWEVER, THE VALUE INDIVIDUAL SCIENTISTS RECEIVE IN EXCHANGE FOR DISSEMINATING KNOWLEDGE DIFFERS ACROSS THESE MECHANISMS, WHICH, CONSEQUENTLY, AFFECTS THEIR SELECTION. SO FAR, VALUE CAPTURE MECHANISMS HAVE MAINLY BEEN DESCRIBED AS APPROPRIATING MONETARY REWARDS IN EXCHANGE FOR SCIENTISTS' KNOWLEDGE (E.G., PATENTING). HOWEVER, MOST KNOWLEDGE DISSEMINATION ACTIVITIES IN SCIENCE DO NOT DIRECTLY RESULT IN CAPTURING MONETARY VALUE (E.G., SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT). BY TAKING A VALUE CAPTURE PERSPECTIVE, THIS ARTICLE CONCEPTUALIZES AND EXPLORES HOW INDIVIDUAL SCIENTISTS CAPTURE VALUE FROM DISSEMINATING THEIR KNOWLEDGE.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: THE DRIVING CLINICAL USE CASE FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF ICEES WAS ASTHMA, WHICH IS A COMMON DISEASE INFLUENCED BY HUNDREDS OF GENES AND A PLETHORA OF ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES, INCLUDING EXPOSURES TO AIRBORNE POLLUTANTS. WE DEVELOPED A PIPELINE FOR INTEGRATING CLINICAL DATA ON PATIENTS WITH ASTHMA-LIKE CONDITIONS WITH DATA ON ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES DERIVED FROM MULTIPLE PUBLIC DATA SOURCES. THE DATA WERE INTEGRATED AT THE PATIENT AND VISIT LEVEL AND USED TO CREATE DE-IDENTIFIED, BINNED, ``INTEGRATED FEATURE TABLES,'' WHICH WERE THEN PLACED BEHIND AN OPENAPI. RESULTS: OUR PRELIMINARY EVALUATION RESULTS DEMONSTRATE A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EXPOSURE TO HIGH LEVELS OF PARTICULATE MATTER <= 2.5 MM IN DIAMETER (PM2.5) AND THE FREQUENCY OF EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT OR INPATIENT VISITS FOR RESPIRATORY ISSUES. FOR EXAMPLE, 16.73\% OF PATIENTS WITH AVERAGE DAILY EXPOSURE TO PM2.5 >9.62 MU G/M(3) EXPERIENCED 2 OR MORE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT OR INPATIENT VISITS FOR RESPIRATORY ISSUES IN YEAR 2010 COMPARED WITH 7.93\% OF PATIENTS WITH LOWER EXPOSURES (N = 23 093).

HERE WE DESCRIBE THE DEVELOPMENT AND PROOF-OF-CONCEPT OF A LOW-COST, SMALL-SIZED AND LOW-ENERGY ACOUSTIC DETECTOR: ``AUDIOMOTH.'' THE DEVICE IS OPEN-SOURCE AND PROGRAMMABLE, WITH DIVERSE APPLICATIONS FOR RECORDING ANIMAL CALLS OR HUMAN ACTIVITY AT SAMPLE RATES OF UP TO 384 KHZ. WE BRIEFLY OUTLINE TWO ONGOING REAL-WORLD CASE STUDIES OF LARGE-SCALE, LONG-TERM MONITORING FOR BIODIVERSITY AND EXPLOITATION OF NATURAL RESOURCES. THESE STUDIES DEMONSTRATE THE POTENTIAL FOR AUDIOMOTH TO ENABLE A SUBSTANTIAL SHIFT AWAY FROM PASSIVE CONTINUOUS RECORDING BY INDIVIDUAL DEVICES, TOWARDS SMART DETECTION BY NETWORKS OF DEVICES FLOODING LARGE AND INACCESSIBLE ECOSYSTEMS. 3. THE CASE STUDIES DEMONSTRATE ONE OF THE SMART CAPABILITIES OF AUDIOMOTH, TO TRIGGER EVENT LOGGING ON THE BASIS OF CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHMS THAT IDENTIFY SPECIFIC ACOUSTIC EVENTS. AN ALGORITHM TO TRIGGER RECORDINGS OF THE NEW FOREST CICADA (CICADETTA MONTANA) DEMONSTRATES THE POTENTIAL FOR AUDIOMOTH TO VASTLY IMPROVE THE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL COVERAGE OF SURVEYS FOR THE PRESENCE OF CRYPTIC ANIMALS. AN ALGORITHM FOR LOGGING GUNSHOT EVENTS HAS POTENTIAL TO IDENTIFY A SHOTGUN BLAST IN TROPICAL RAINFOREST AT DISTANCES OF UP TO 500 M, EXTENDING TO 1 KM WITH CONTINUOUS RECORDING. 4.

HOWEVER, THESE NETWORKS ARE TYPICALLY DEPLOYED IN HOSTILE ENVIRONMENTS AND IN WHICH PRIVACY AND DATA INTEGRITY ARE WIDELY DESIRED. BECAUSE OF THEIR DESIGN, WIRELESS SENSORS CAN BE EASILY CAPTURED. ALSO, NODES THAT PERFORM THE AGGREGATION FUNCTION ARE MOST ATTRACTIVE TO ATTACKERS. THEREFORE, IN ORDER TO DEAL WITH THESE SECURITY THREATS, THE RESEARCH ON DATA AGGREGATION SECURITY IS ESSENTIAL. IN THIS CONTEXT, SEVERAL SOLUTIONS HAVE BEEN PROPOSED TO SECURE DATA AGGREGATION IN SENSOR NETWORKS, BASED ON SEVERAL ENCRYPTION TECHNIQUES. AMONG THESE, THERE IS THE HOMOMORPHIC ENCRYPTION. COMPARED TO OTHER TECHNIQUES, IN HOMOMORPHIC ENCRYPTION ALL THE SENSOR NODES PARTICIPATE IN THE AGGREGATION, WITHOUT SEEING ANY INTERMEDIATE OR FINAL RESULT, WHILE STILL MAINTAINING AN EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT AGGREGATION PROCESS.

ROAD SAFETY AND TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT APPLICATIONS REQUIRE A RELIABLE COMMUNICATION SCHEME WITH MINIMAL TRANSMISSION COLLISIONS, WHICH THUS INCREASE THE NEED FOR AN EFFICIENT MEDIUM ACCESS CONTROL (MAC) PROTOCOL.

HOWEVER, THIS HAS CREATED A WEALTH OF DATA FOR INTERROGATION.RESULTSHERE, WE USED THE FIELD PATHOGENOMICS APPROACH TO GENERATE 538 NEW RNA-SEQ DATASETS FROM PST-INFECTED FIELD WHEAT SAMPLES, DOUBLING THE AMOUNT OF TRANSCRIPTOMICS DATA AVAILABLE FOR THIS IMPORTANT PATHOSYSTEM. WE THEN ANALYSED THESE DATASETS ALONGSIDE 66 RNA-SEQ DATASETS FROM FOUR PST INFECTION TIME-COURSES AND 420 PST-INFECTED PLANT FIELD AND LABORATORY SAMPLES THAT WERE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE. A DATABASE OF GENE EXPRESSION VALUES FOR PST AND WHEAT WAS GENERATED FOR EACH OF THESE 1024 RNA-SEQ DATASETS AND INCORPORATED INTO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RUST EXPRESSION BROWSER (HTTP://WWW.RUST-EXPRESSION.COM). THIS ENABLES FOR THE FIRST TIME SIMULTANEOUS `POINT-AND-CLICK' ACCESS TO GENE EXPRESSION PROFILES FOR PST AND ITS WHEAT HOST AND REPRESENTS THE LARGEST DATABASE OF PROCESSED RNA-SEQ DATASETS AVAILABLE FOR ANY OF THE THREE PUCCINIA WHEAT RUST PATHOGENS. WE ALSO DEMONSTRATED THE UTILITY OF THE BROWSER THROUGH INVESTIGATION OF EXPRESSION OF PUTATIVE PST VIRULENCE GENES OVER TIME AND EXAMINED THE HOST PLANTS RESPONSE TO PST INFECTION.CONCLUSIONSTHE RUST EXPRESSION BROWSER OFFERS IMMENSE VALUE TO THE WIDER COMMUNITY, FACILITATING DATA SHARING AND TRANSPARENCY AND THE UNDERLYING DATABASE CAN BE CONTINUALLY EXPANDED AS MORE DATASETS BECOME PUBLICLY AVAILABLE.",RNA-SEQ; WHEAT; ARCHITECTURE; ARABIDOPSIS; RESISTANCE; REVEALS; EDS1,10.1186/s12864-021-07488-3,0,uncertain,45,,exclude,48,,0,inconsistent

IN THIS PERSPECTIVE ARTICLE I DISCUSS TWO QUESTIONS. FIRST, WHY ARE THE RESULTS OF ANIMAL EXPERIMENTS OFTEN SO DIFFICULT TO TRANSFER TO HUMANS? AND SECOND, WHAT CAN BE DONE TO IMPROVE TRANSLATION FROM ANIMAL EXPERIMENTS TO HUMANS? TRANSLATION FAILURES ARE OFTEN THE RESULT OF POOR METHODOLOGY. IT IS NOT MERELY THE FACT THAT LOW STATISTICAL POWER OF BASIC AND PRECLINICAL STUDIES UNDERMINE A ``REAL EFFECT,'' BUT THE ACCURACY WITH WHICH DATA FROM ANIMAL STUDIES ARE COLLECTED AND DESCRIBED, AND THE RESULTING ROBUSTNESS OF THE DATA IS GENERALLY VERY LOW AND OFTEN DOES NOT ALLOW TRANSLATION TO A MUCH MORE HETEROGENEOUS HUMAN CONDITION. EQUALLY IMPORTANT IS THE FACT THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF PUBLICATIONS IN THE BIOMEDICAL FIELD IN THE LAST FEW DECADES HAVE REPORTED POSITIVE FINDINGS AND HAVE THUS GENERATED A KNOWLEDGE BIAS. FURTHER CONTRIBUTIONS TO REPRODUCIBILITY AND TRANSLATION FAILURES ARE DISCUSSED IN THIS PAPER, AND 10 POINTS OF RECOMMENDATION TO IMPROVE REPRODUCIBILITY AND TRANSLATION ARE OUTLINED. THESE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE: (I) PRIOR TO PLANNING AN ACTUAL STUDY, A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OR POTENTIAL PRECLINICAL META-ANALYSIS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED. (II) AN A PRIORI POWER CALCULATION SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT. (III) THE EXPERIMENTAL STUDY PROTOCOL SHOULD BE PRE-REGISTERED. (IV) THE EXECUTION OF THE STUDY SHOULD BE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE MOST RECENT ARRIVE GUIDELINES. (V) WHEN PLANNING THE STUDY, THE GENERALIZABILITY OF THE DATA TO BE COLLECTED SHOULD ALSO BE CONSIDERED (E.G., SEX OR AGE DIFFERENCES). (VI) ``METHOD-HOPPING'' SHOULD BE AVOIDED, MEANING THAT IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO USE THE MOST ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY BUT RATHER TO HAVE THE APPLIED METHODOLOGY UNDER CONTROL. (VII) NATIONAL OR INTERNATIONAL NETWORKS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED TO CARRY OUT MULTICENTER PRECLINICAL STUDIES OR TO OBTAIN CONVERGENT EVIDENCE. (VIII) ANIMAL MODELS THAT CAPTURE DSM-5 OR ICD-11 CRITERIA SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN THE CONTEXT OF RESEARCH ON PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS. (IX) RAW DATA OF PUBLICATION SHOULD BE MADE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE AND SHOULD BE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FAIR GUIDING PRINCIPLES FOR SCIENTIFIC DATA MANAGEMENT. (X) FINALLY, NEGATIVE FINDINGS SHOULD BE PUBLISHED TO COUNTERACT PUBLICATION BIAS. THE APPLICATION OF THESE 10 POINTS OF RECOMMENDATION, ESPECIALLY FOR PRECLINICAL CONFIRMATORY STUDIES BUT ALSO TO SOME DEGREE FOR EXPLORATORY STUDIES, WILL ULTIMATELY IMPROVE THE REPRODUCIBILITY AND TRANSLATION OF ANIMAL RESEARCH.",CORTICOTROPIN-RELEASING-FACTOR; PLACEBO-CONTROLLED TRIAL; ANTAGONIST;; MODELS; METAANALYSIS; GUIDELINES; BEHAVIOR; WOMEN; CELL; NIH,10.3389/fnbeh.2022.869511,0,include,49,,include,48,,0,include

HOWEVER, INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS, COMPARISON WITH PREVIOUSLY AVAILABLE PHYLOGENETIC HYPOTHESES, AND SELECTION OF ONE PHYLOGENY FOR DOWNSTREAM ANALYSES AND DISCUSSION STILL IMPOSE DIFFICULTIES TO ONE THAT IS NOT A SPECIALIST EITHER ON PHYLOGENETIC METHODS OR ON A PARTICULAR GROUP OF STUDY. RESULTS PHYSCRAPER IS A COMMAND-LINE PYTHON PROGRAM THAT AUTOMATES THE UPDATE OF PUBLISHED PHYLOGENIES BY ADDING PUBLIC DNA SEQUENCES TO UNDERLYING ALIGNMENTS OF PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED PHYLOGENIES. IT ALSO PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK FOR STRAIGHTFORWARD COMPARISON OF PUBLISHED PHYLOGENIES WITH THEIR UPDATED VERSIONS, BY LEVERAGING UPON TOOLS FROM THE OPEN TREE OF LIFE PROJECT TO LINK TAXONOMIC INFORMATION ACROSS DATABASES.

CHILDREN PROGRESSIVELY DEVELOP VARYING DEGREES OF COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT WHICH MAY LEAD TO SEVERE WASTING, A VEGETATIVE STATE AND, EVENTUALLY, DEATH. DESPITE ITS 50-YEAR EXISTENCE, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT ITS CAUSE, RISK FACTORS AND PROGNOSIS. IT IS A DISEASE WHERE MARKETS WILL NOT PROVIDE SOLUTIONS BECAUSE THE PATIENTS ARE BOTH TOO FEW AND TOO POOR, MAKING IT ESPECIALLY NEGLECTED. OPEN SOURCE INNOVATION HAS BEEN RECOMMENDED AS AN APPROACH TO NEGLECTED DISEASE RESEARCH IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE AVAILABLE FUNDING THROUGH GREATER COLLABORATION AND OPENNESS TO RESULTS. NODDING SYNDROME IS A USEFUL CASE TO EXAMINE THE RELEVANCE OF OPEN SOURCE INNOVATION. METHODS: WE ASSESSED THE MAGNITUDE OF RESEARCH RELATED TO NODDING SYNDROME, ITS AVAILABILITY, FINANCING AND THE AMOUNT OF COLLABORATION. WE SURVEYED RESEARCHERS REGARDING THEIR MOTIVATIONS, ATTITUDES TOWARD OPEN SOURCE INNOVATION CONCEPTS AND BARRIERS TO GREATER COLLABORATION. RESULTS: LITTLE RESEARCH IS OCCURRING FOR NODDING SYNDROME, BUT IT IS OPENLY AVAILABLE AND RESEARCHERS ARE HIGHLY COLLABORATIVE. THE DISEASE IS LARGELY UNKNOWN, WHICH IS PARTLY ATTRIBUTED TO WHO NOT CLASSIFYING NODDING SYNDROME AS A NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASE AND NOT INCLUDING IT IN ANY FORMAL PROGRAMME.

THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM IS ONE OF THE MOST INTRIGUING SYSTEMS IN COMPLEX METAZOANS, AS IT CONTROLS ALL BODY AND MIND FUNCTIONS. ITS FAILURE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR A NUMBER OF SEVERE AND LARGELY INCURABLE DISEASES, INCLUDING NEUROLOGICAL AND NEURODEGENERATIVE ONES. MOREOVER, THE EVOLUTION OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM IS THOUGHT TO BE A CRITICAL STEP IN THE ADAPTIVE RADIATION OF VERTEBRATES. BRAIN FORMATION IS INITIATED EARLY DURING DEVELOPMENT. MOST EMBRYOLOGICAL, GENETIC AND EVOLUTIONARY STUDIES HAVE FOCUSED ON BRAIN NEUROGENESIS AND REGIONALISATION, INCLUDING THE FORMATION AND FUNCTION OF ORGANISING CENTRES, AND THE COMPARISON OF HOMOLOG GENE EXPRESSION AND FUNCTION AMONG MODEL ORGANISMS FROM DIFFERENT TAXA. THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE VERTEBRATE BRAIN PRIMORDIUM ALSO REVEALS THE EXISTENCE OF CONNECTED INTERNAL CAVITIES, THE CEPHALIC VESICLES, WHICH IN FETUSES AND ADULTS BECOME THE VENTRICULAR SYSTEM OF THE BRAIN. DURING EMBRYONIC AND FETAL DEVELOPMENT, BRAIN CAVITIES AND VENTRICLES ARE FILLED WITH A COMPLEX, PROTEIN-RICH FLUID CALLED CEREBROSPINAL FLUID (CSF). HOWEVER, CSF HAS NOT BEEN WIDELY ANALYSED FROM EITHER AN EMBRYOLOGICAL OR EVOLUTIONARY PERSPECTIVE. RECENTLY, IT HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED IN HIGHER VERTEBRATES THAT EMBRYONIC CEREBROSPINAL FLUID HAS KEY FUNCTIONS IN DELIVERING DIFFUSIBLE SIGNALS AND NUTRIENTS TO THE DEVELOPING BRAIN, THUS CONTRIBUTING TO THE PROLIFERATION, DIFFERENTIATION AND SURVIVAL OF NEURAL PROGENITOR CELLS, AND TO THE EXPANSION AND PATTERNING OF THE BRAIN.

WITH THE TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENT OF VEHICLES' ON-BOARD UNITS, THEIR COMPUTING CAPABILITIES ARE BECOMING ROBUST, AND CONSIDERING THE UNDERUTILIZATION OF THE OFF-STREET VEHICLES, WE ENVISION THAT THE OFF-STREET VEHICLES CAN BE AN ENORMOUSLY USEFUL COMPUTATIONAL SOURCE FOR THE FOG COMPUTING. ADDITIONALLY, CLUSTERING THE VEHICLES WOULD BE ADVANTAGEOUS IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THE SERVICE AVAILABILITY. AS THE VEHICLES BECOME HIGHLY CONNECTED, TRUST IS NEEDED ESPECIALLY IN DISTRIBUTED ENVIRONMENTS. HOWEVER, VEHICLES ARE MADE FROM DIFFERENT MANUFACTURERS, AND HAVE DIFFERENT PLATFORMS, SECURITY MECHANISMS, AND VARYING PARKING DURATION. THESE LEAD TO THE UNPREDICTABLE BEHAVIOR OF THE VEHICLES WHERE QUANTIFYING TRUST VALUE OF VEHICLES WOULD BE DIFFICULT. A TRUST-BASED SOLUTION IS NECESSARY FOR TASK MAPPING AS A TASK HAS A SET OF PROPERTIES INCLUDING EXPECTED TIME TO COMPLETE, AND TRUST REQUIREMENTS THAT NEED TO BE MET. HOWEVER, THE EXISTING METRICS USED FOR TRUST EVALUATION IN THE VEHICULAR FOG COMPUTING SUCH AS VELOCITY AND DIRECTION ARE NOT APPLICABLE IN THE OFF-STREET VEHICLE FOG ENVIRONMENTS. IN THIS PAPER, WE PROPOSE A FRAMEWORK FOR QUANTIFYING THE TRUST VALUE OF OFF-STREET VEHICLE FOG COMPUTING FACILITIES IN 5G NETWORKS AND FORMING LOGICAL CLUSTERS OF VEHICLES BASED ON THE TRUST VALUES. THIS ALLOWS TASKS TO BE SHARED WITH MULTIPLE VEHICLES IN THE SAME CLUSTER THAT MEETS THE TASKS' TRUST REQUIREMENTS.

WE RECENTLY DEVELOPED A METHOD FOR USING ICEES TO GENERATE MULTIVARIATE TABLES FOR SUBSEQUENT APPLICATION OF MACHINE LEARNING AND STATISTICAL MODELS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO USE THIS APPROACH TO IDENTIFY PREDICTORS OF ASTHMA EXACERBATIONS THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF THREE MULTIVARIATE METHODS: CONDITIONAL RANDOM FOREST, CONDITIONAL TREE, AND GENERALIZED LINEAR MODEL. AMONG SEVEN POTENTIAL PREDICTOR VARIABLES, WE FOUND FIVE TO BE OF SIGNIFICANT IMPORTANCE USING BOTH CONDITIONAL RANDOM FOREST AND CONDITIONAL TREE: PREDNISONE, RACE, AIRBORNE PARTICULATE EXPOSURE, OBESITY, AND SEX. THE CONDITIONAL TREE METHOD ADDITIONALLY IDENTIFIED SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT TWO-WAY AND THREE-WAY INTERACTIONS AMONG THE SAME VARIABLES.

WHEN RANKED IN ORDER BY EFFECT SIZE, THE RESULTS WERE IN AGREEMENT WITH THE RESULTS FROM THE CONDITIONAL RANDOM FOREST AND CONDITIONAL TREE METHODS AS WELL AS THE PUBLISHED LITERATURE.

THIS DEVELOPMENT HAS FACILITATED AN UPSURGE IN INFORMATION ON INVASIONS, BUT IT ALSO CREATES CONCEPTUAL AND PRACTICAL CHALLENGES. TO PROVIDE MORE TRANSPARENCY ON WHICH KIND OF RESEARCH IS ACTUALLY DONE IN THE FIELD, THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN INVASION SCIENCE, ENCOMPASSING THE FULL SPECTRUM OF STUDIES ON BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS AND THE SUB-FIELD OF INVASION BIOLOGY, STUDYING PATTERNS AND MECHANISMS OF SPECIES INVASIONS WITH A FOCUS ON BIOLOGICAL RESEARCH QUESTIONS, CAN BE USEFUL.

INVASION BIOLOGY CONSISTS OF THE BUILDING BLOCKS `THEORY', `CASE STUDIES' AND `APPLICATION', WHERE THEORY TAKES THE FORM OF CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORKS, MAJOR HYPOTHESES AND STATISTICAL GENERALISATIONS. REFERENCING RECENT WORK IN PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE, WE ARGUE THAT INVASION BIOLOGY, LIKE OTHER BIOLOGICAL OR ECOLOGICAL DISCIPLINES, DOES NOT RELY ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ALL-ENCOMPASSING THEORY IN ORDER TO BE EFFICIENT.

THE DEGREE OF ELASTICITY OF THIS ADDITIONAL ELECTRICITY DEMAND CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE ELECTRICITY SYSTEM. THIS PAPER INVESTIGATES THE EFFECT OF DECENTRAL HEAT PUMP FLEXIBILISATION THROUGH THERMAL ENERGY STORAGE UNITS ON ELECTRICITY STORAGE INVESTMENT. THE ANALYSIS IS CARRIED USING AN OPEN SOURCE MODEL FOR THE GERMAN ELECTRICITY SYSTEM BASED ON THE OPEN ENERGY MODELLING FRAMEWORK (OEMOF). RESULTS HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF FLEXIBLE HEAT PUMP OPERATION IN 100\% RENEWABLE ENERGY SYSTEMS AND RELATE WELL TO FINDINGS OF OTHER EXISTING STUDIES. FLEXIBILISATION OF HEAT PUMPS IN THE GERMAN ENERGY SYSTEM CAN REDUCE THE NEED FOR ELECTRICITY STORAGE UNITS SIGNIFICANTLY. WHILE NO IMPACT WAS FOUND FOR SYSTEMS WITH A SHARE BELOW 80\% RENEWABLE ENERGY, INVESTMENT IN SHORT TERM STORAGE UNITS IS REDUCED BY UP TO 42-62\% IN SYSTEMS WITH SHARES OF MORE THAN 80\% RENEWABLE ENERGY. IN CONTRAST, THE IMPACT ON LONG TERM ELECTRICITY STORAGE INVESTMENT WAS COMPARATIVELY LOW IN ALL MODELLED SCENARIOS. CONDUCTED SENSITIVITY ANALYSES SHOW THAT BOTH FINDINGS ARE RATHER INSENSITIVE WITH REGARD TO THE AVAILABLE BIOMASS FOR ELECTRICITY SUPPLY AS WELL AS TO CHANGES IN THE HEAT DEMAND COVERED BY HEAT PUMPS.

THE INTEGRATING DATA SCIENCE WITH TREES AND REMOTE SENSING (IDTREES) PLANT IDENTIFICATION COMPETITION OPENLY INVITED SCIENTISTS TO CREATE AND COMPARE INDIVIDUAL TREE MAPPING METHODS. PARTICIPANTS WERE TASKED WITH TRAINING TAXON IDENTIFICATION ALGORITHMS BASED ON TWO SITES, TO THEN TRANSFER THEIR METHODS TO A THIRD UNSEEN SITE, USING FIELD-BASED PLANT OBSERVATIONS IN COMBINATION WITH AIRBORNE REMOTE SENSING IMAGE DATA PRODUCTS FROM THE NATIONAL ECOLOGICAL OBSERVATORY NETWORK (NEON). THESE DATA WERE CAPTURED BY A HIGH RESOLUTION DIGITAL CAMERA SENSITIVE TO RED, GREEN, BLUE (RGB) LIGHT, HYPERSPECTRAL IMAGING SPECTROMETER SPANNING THE VISIBLE TO SHORTWAVE INFRARED WAVELENGTHS, AND LIDAR SYSTEMS TO CAPTURE THE SPECTRAL AND STRUCTURAL PROPERTIES OF VEGETATION. AS PARTICIPANTS IN THE IDTREES COMPETITION, WE DEVELOPED A TWO-STAGE DEEP LEARNING APPROACH TO INTEGRATE NEON REMOTE SENSING DATA FROM ALL THREE SENSORS AND CLASSIFY INDIVIDUAL PLANT SPECIES AND GENERA.

ONE IMPEDIMENT IS THE LARGE NUMBER OF UNDESCRIBED SPECIES (HERE CALLED ``DARK TAXON IMPEDIMENT'') WHEREAS ANOTHER IS CAUSED BY THE LARGE NUMBER OF SUPERFICIAL SPECIES DESCRIPTIONS, THAT CAN ONLY BE RESOLVED BY CONSULTING TYPE SPECIMENS (''SUPERFICIAL DESCRIPTION IMPEDIMENT''). RECENTLY, SHARKEY ET AL. (2021) PROPOSED TO ADDRESS THE DARK TAXON IMPEDIMENT FOR COSTA RICAN BRACONID WASPS BY DESCRIBING 403 SPECIES BASED ON COI BARCODE CLUSTERS (''BINS'') COMPUTED BY BOLD SYSTEMS. MORE THAN 99\% OF THE BINS (387 OF 390) WERE CONVERTED INTO SPECIES BY ASSIGNING BINOMINAL NAMES (E.G. BIN ``BOLD:ACM9419'' BECOMES BRACON FEDERICOMATARRITAI) AND ADDING A MINIMAL DIAGNOSIS (CONSISTING ONLY OF A CONSENSUS BARCODE FOR MOST SPECIES). WE HERE SHOW THAT MANY OF SHARKEY ET AL.'S SPECIES ARE UNSTABLE WHEN THE UNDERLYING DATA ARE ANALYZED USING DIFFERENT SPECIES DELIMITATION ALGORITHMS. ADD THE INSUFFICIENTLY INFORMATIVE DIAGNOSES, AND MANY OF THESE SPECIES WILL BECOME THE NEXT ``SUPERFICIAL DESCRIPTION IMPEDIMENT'' FOR BRACONID TAXONOMY BECAUSE THEY WILL HAVE TO BE TESTED AND REDESCRIBED AFTER OBTAINING SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE FOR CONFIDENTLY DELIMITING SPECIES. WE FURTHERMORE SHOW THAT SHARKEY ET AL.'S APPROACH OF USING CONSENSUS BARCODES AS DIAGNOSES IS NOT FUNCTIONAL BECAUSE IT CANNOT BE APPLIED CONSISTENTLY. LASTLY, WE REITERATE THAT COI ALONE IS NOT SUITABLE FOR DELIMITING AND DESCRIBING SPECIES, AND VOICE CONCERNS OVER SHARKEY ET AL.'S UNCRITICAL USE OF BINS BECAUSE THEY ARE CALCULATED BY A PROPRIETARY ALGORITHM (RESL) THAT USES A MIXTURE OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE DATA.

HOWEVER, TO THIS POINT, THERE HAS BEEN NO CROSS-ECOSYSTEM ANALYSIS OF NEAR-TERM ECOLOGICAL FORECASTS, MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO SYNTHESIZE DIVERSE RESEARCH EFFORTS AND PRIORITIZE FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS FOR THIS EMERGING FIELD. IN THIS STUDY, WE ANALYZED 178 NEAR-TERM (<= 10-YR FORECAST HORIZON) ECOLOGICAL FORECASTING PAPERS TO UNDERSTAND THE DEVELOPMENT AND CURRENT STATE OF NEAR-TERM ECOLOGICAL FORECASTING LITERATURE AND TO COMPARE FORECAST ACCURACY ACROSS SCALES AND VARIABLES. OUR RESULTS INDICATED THAT NEAR-TERM ECOLOGICAL FORECASTING IS WIDESPREAD AND GROWING: FORECASTS HAVE BEEN PRODUCED FOR SITES ON ALL SEVEN CONTINENTS AND THE RATE OF FORECAST PUBLICATION IS INCREASING OVER TIME. AS FORECAST PRODUCTION HAS ACCELERATED, SOME BEST PRACTICES HAVE BEEN PROPOSED AND APPLICATION OF THESE BEST PRACTICES IS INCREASING. IN PARTICULAR, DATA PUBLICATION, FORECAST ARCHIVING, AND WORKFLOW AUTOMATION HAVE ALL INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY OVER TIME. HOWEVER, ADOPTION OF PROPOSED BEST PRACTICES REMAINS LOW OVERALL: FOR EXAMPLE, DESPITE THE FACT THAT UNCERTAINTY IS OFTEN CITED AS AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF AN ECOLOGICAL FORECAST, ONLY 45\% OF PAPERS INCLUDED UNCERTAINTY IN THEIR FORECAST OUTPUTS. AS THE USE OF THESE PROPOSED BEST PRACTICES INCREASES, NEAR-TERM ECOLOGICAL FORECASTING HAS THE POTENTIAL TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF FORECASTABILITY ACROSS SCALES AND VARIABLES. IN THIS STUDY, WE FOUND THAT FORECASTABILITY (DEFINED HERE AS REALIZED FORECAST ACCURACY) DECREASED IN PREDICTABLE PATTERNS OVER 1-7 D FORECAST HORIZONS. VARIABLES THAT WERE CLOSELY RELATED (I.E., CHLOROPHYLL AND PHYTOPLANKTON) DISPLAYED VERY SIMILAR TRENDS IN FORECASTABILITY, WHILE MORE DISTANTLY RELATED VARIABLES (I.E., POLLEN AND EVAPOTRANSPIRATION) EXHIBITED SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT PATTERNS.

IN EXPERIMENT 1, WE FOUND THAT COLLECTIVE JUDGMENTS IN FACE-TO-FACE INTERACTIONS WERE MORE UTILITARIAN THAN THE STATISTICAL AGGREGATE OF THEIR MEMBERS COMPARED TO BOTH FIRST AND SECOND INDIVIDUAL JUDGMENTS.

A MAJOR STEP TO OPEN SCIENCE HAS BEEN TAKEN WHEN ACADEMIC JOURNAL PUBLISHERS, LEADING UNIVERSITIES, RESEARCH CHARITIES HAVE TAKEN RESPONSIBILITY TO WORK IN A COLLABORATIVE MANNER AND SHARE CORONAVIRUS INFECTION RESEARCH DATA AND RESULTS SPEEDILY AND FREELY. TRANSITION TO DIGITAL COLLECTIONS IN LIBRARY HOLDINGS HAS ACCELERATED, COLLECTIONS OF E-BOOKS ARE GROWING, AND THE EFFECT OF PRIOR DIGITIZATION PROJECTS HAS MANIFESTED ITSELF.

THIS ARTICLE PROPOSES A 4-STEP MODEL FOR SCIENTIFIC DISSEMINATION THAT AIMS TO PROMOTE EVIDENCE-BASED PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE IN OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT OR HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AS WELL AS RESEARCH WITH A MORE TRANSPARENT AND REPRODUCIBLE PROCESS. THESE 4 STEPS INCLUDE:1 SOCIAL NETWORK ANNOUNCEMENTS, 2 DISSEMINATION TO SCIENTIFIC JOURNALS, 3 DISSEMINATION TO SOCIAL NETWORKS, AND 4 SCIENTIFIC DISSEMINATION TO PROFESSIONAL JOURNALS. CENTRAL TO THE 4-STEP MODEL IS A THREE-STAGE PUBLICATION PROCESS WITHIN THE SECOND STEP, WHICH ADDS AN ADDITIONAL STAGE TO THE TWO PREVIOUSLY PROPOSED (MARIN-GARCIA, 2015). THESE THREE PUBLICATION STAGES BEGIN WITH A PROTOCOL PAPER, ARE FOLLOWED BY A DATA PAPER, AND FINISH WITH A TRADITIONAL ARTICLE. EACH STAGE PROMOTES RESEARCH WITH MERIT WHICH IS CITABLE AND RECOGNIZABLE AS SUCH BEFORE THE SCIENTIFIC EVALUATION BODIES. AS TWO OF THESE STAGES ARE LARGELY UNKNOWN WITHIN THE FIELDS OF BUSINESS AND MANAGEMENT, I DEFINE THE DETAILS OF A PROTOCOL PAPER AND A DATA PAPER INCLUDING THEIR CONTENTS. IN ADDITION, I PROVIDE EXAMPLES OF BOTH PAPERS AS WELL AS THE OTHER STEPS OF THE SCIENCE DISSEMINATION MODEL. THIS MODEL CAN BE ADOPTED BY RESEARCHERS AS A MEANS OF ACHIEVING GREATER IMPACT AND TRANSFER OF RESEARCH RESULTS. THIS WORK INTENDS TO HELP RESEARCHERS TO UNDERSTAND, TO EVALUATE, AND TO MAKE BETTER DECISIONS ABOUT HOW THEIR RESEARCH REACHES SOCIETY AT LARGE OUTSIDE OF ACADEMIA. IN THIS WAY, WPOM ALIGNS WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF SEVERAL LEADING JOURNALS IN THE FIELD OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT ON THE NEED TO PROMOTE TRANSPARENT, ACCESSIBLE, AND REPLICABLE SCIENCE (BEUGELSDIJK ET AL., 2020). WPOM GOES ONE STEP FURTHER IN COMPLIANCE WITH THIS DIRECTION BY HAVING RELEVANT JOURNALS THAT NOT ONLY ACCEPT, BUT ALSO ACTIVELY ENCOURAGE THE PUBLICATION OF PROTOCOL PAPERS AND DATA PAPERS. WP0.4,1 STRIVES TO PIONEER IN THIS FIELD OF BUSINESS AND MANAGEMENT. THIS ARTICLE ALSO EXPLORES THE POTENTIAL PREVALENCE OFPROTOCOL PAPERS AND DATA PAPERS WITHIN THE SET OF ALL ARTICLES PUBLISHED IN JOURNALS INDEXED IN CLARIVATE WEB OF SCIENCE AND SCOPUS. WITH THIS EDITORIAL, WPOM IS COMMITTED TO PROMOTING THIS MODEL BY ACCEPTING FOR REVIEW ANY OF THE THREE TYPES OF SCIENTIFIC CONTRIBUTIONS INCLUDING PROTOCOL PAPERS, DATA PAPERS, AND TRADITIONAL PAPERS.

EARLY RESEARCH FOUND SUBSTANTIAL ECONOMIC SAVINGS FOR THESE TECHNOLOGIES, BUT AS THE OPEN SOURCE DESIGN PARADIGM HAS GROWN BY ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE SAVINGS OBSERVED IN THE EARLY WORK WAS ISOLATED TO SPECIAL CASES. TODAY THERE ARE EXAMPLES OF OPEN SOURCE TECHNOLOGY FOR SCIENCE IN THE VAST MAJORITY OF DISCIPLINES AND SEVERAL RESOURCES DEDICATED SPECIFICALLY TO PUBLISHING THEM. DO THE TREMENDOUS ECONOMIC SAVINGS OBSERVED EARLIER HOLD TODAY? TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION, THIS STUDY EVALUATES FREE AND OPEN SOURCE TECHNOLOGIES IN THE TWO REPOSITORIES COMPARED TO PROPRIETARY FUNCTIONALLY-EQUIVALENT TOOLS AS A FUNCTION OF THEIR USE OF ARDUINO-BASED ELECTRONICS, REPRAP-CLASS 3-D PRINTING, AS WELL AS THE COMBINATION OF THE TWO. THE RESULTS OF THE REVIEW FIND OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE FOR A WIDE RANGE OF SCIENTIFIC TOOLS, THAT OPEN SOURCE TECHNOLOGIES PROVIDE ECONOMIC SAVINGS OF 87\% COMPARED TO EQUIVALENT OR LESSER PROPRIETARY TOOLS. THESE ECONOMIC SAVINGS INCREASED SLIGHTLY TO 89\% FOR THOSE THAT USED ARDUINO TECHNOLOGY AND EVEN MORE TO 92\% FOR THOSE THAT USED REPRAP-CLASS 3-D PRINTING. COMBINING BOTH ARDUINO AND 3-D PRINTING THE SAVINGS AVERAGED 94\% FOR FREE AND OPEN SOURCE TOOLS OVER COMMERCIAL EQUIVALENTS. THE RESULTS PROVIDE STRONG EVIDENCE FOR FINANCIAL SUPPORT OF OPEN SOURCE HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT FOR THE SCIENCES. GIVEN THE OVERWHELMING ECONOMIC ADVANTAGES OF FREE AND OPEN SOURCE TECHNOLOGIES, IT APPEARS FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE TO DIVERT FUNDING OF PROPRIETARY SCIENTIFIC TOOLS AND THEIR DEVELOPMENT IN FAVOR OF FOSH.

THE TRANSIENT THERMAL CHARACTERISTICS OF PULSE OPERATED ALGAN/GAN HIGH ELECTRON MOBILITY TRANSISTORS (HEMT) USED IN HIGH POWER AMPLIFIERS ARE SYSTEMATICALLY INVESTIGATED BY USING THREE-DIMENSIONAL SIMULATION WITH THE FINITE ELEMENT METHOD. TO IMPROVE THE CALCULATION ACCURACY, THE NONLINEAR THERMAL CONDUCTIVITIES AND NEAR-JUNCTION REGION OF GAN CHIP ARE CONSIDERED AND TREATED APPROPRIATELY IN OUR NUMERICAL ANALYSIS. THE PERIODIC TRANSIENT PULSES TEMPERATURE AND TEMPERATURE DISTRIBUTION ARE ANALYZED TO ESTIMATE THERMAL RESPONSE WHEN GAN AMPLIFIERS ARE OPERATING IN PULSED MODE WITH KILOWATT-LEVEL POWER, AND THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN CHANNEL TEMPERATURES AND PULSE WIDTH, GATE STRUCTURES, AND POWER DENSITY OF GAN DEVICE ARE ANALYZED. RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE MAXIMAL CHANNEL TEMPERATURE AND THERMAL IMPEDANCE OF DEVICE ARE CONSIDERABLY INFLUENCED BY PULSE WIDTH AND POWER DENSITY EFFECTS, BUT THE CHANGES OF GATE FINGERS AND GATE WIDTH HAVE NO EFFECT ON CHANNEL TEMPERATURE WHEN THE TOTAL GATE WIDTH AND ACTIVE AREA ARE KEPT CONSTANT. FINALLY, THE TRANSIENT THERMAL RESPONSE OF GAN AMPLIFIER IS MEASURED USING IR THERMAL PHOTOGRAMMETRY, AND THE CORRECTNESS AND VALIDATION OF THE SIMULATION MODEL IS VERIFIED.

IN THIS REGARD, APPLICATION-SPECIFIC QOS PROVISIONING TECHNIQUES HAVE RECEIVED CONSIDERABLE RESEARCH ATTENTION AT THE MEDIUM ACCESS CONTROL (MAC) LAYER. THIS STUDY PRESENTS A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF THE QOS MECHANISMS EMPLOYED AT THE MAC LAYER IN WSN AND ALSO HIGHLIGHTS THEIR OPEN RESEARCH ISSUES.

THEY WERE ADOPTED BY THE HGP AT A STRATEGY MEETING IN BERMUDA IN FEBRUARY OF 1996 AND IMPLEMENTED IN FORMAL POLICIES BY EARLY 1998, MANDATING DAILY RELEASE OF HGP-FUNDED DNA SEQUENCES INTO THE PUBLIC DOMAIN. THE IDEA OF DAILY SHARING, WE ARGUE, EMANATED DIRECTLY FROM STRATEGIES FOR LARGE, GOAL-DIRECTED MOLECULAR BIOLOGY PROJECTS FIRST TESTED WITHIN THE COMMUNITY OF C. ELEGANS RESEARCHERS, AND WERE INTRODUCED AND DEFENDED FOR THE HGP BY THE NEMATODE BIOLOGISTS JOHN SULSTON AND ROBERT WATERSTON. IN THE C. ELEGANS COMMUNITY, AND SUBSEQUENTLY IN THE HGP, DAILY SHARING SERVED THE PRAGMATIC GOALS OF QUALITY CONTROL AND PROJECT COORDINATION. YET IN THE HGP HUMAN GENOME, WE ALSO ARGUE, THE BERMUDA PRINCIPLES ADDRESSED CONCERNS ABOUT GENE PATENTS IMPEDING SCIENTIFIC ADVANCEMENT, AND WERE ASPIRATIONAL AND FLEXIBLE IN IMPLEMENTATION AND JUSTIFICATION. THEY ENDURED AS AN ARCHETYPE FOR HOW RAPID DATA SHARING COULD BE REALIZED AND RATIONALIZED, AND PERMITTED ADAPTATION TO THE NEEDS OF VARIOUS SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITIES. YET IN ADDITION TO THE SUPPORT OF SULSTON AND WATERSTON, THEIR ADOPTION ALSO DEPENDED ON THE CLOUT OF ADMINISTRATORS AT THE US NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH (NIH) AND THE UK NONPROFIT CHARITY THE WELLCOME TRUST, WHICH TOGETHER FUNDED 90\% OF THE HGP HUMAN SEQUENCING EFFORT. THE OTHER NATIONS WISHING TO REMAIN IN THE HGP CONSORTIUM HAD TO ACCOMMODATE TO THE BERMUDA PRINCIPLES, REQUIRING EXCEPTIONS FROM INCOMPATIBLE EXISTING OR PENDING DATA ACCESS POLICIES FOR PUBLICLY FUNDED RESEARCH IN GERMANY, JAPAN, AND FRANCE. WE BEGIN THIS STORY IN 1963, WITH THE BIOLOGIST SYDNEY BRENNER'S PROPOSAL FOR A NEMATODE RESEARCH PROGRAM AT THE LABORATORY OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY (LMB) AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE.
