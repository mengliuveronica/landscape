526,what makes companies pursue an open science strategy?,r\&d; industrial science; knowledge disclosure; university-industry; collaboration; open innovation; reciprocity,"whereas recent scholarly research has provided many insights about universities engaging in commercial activities, there is still little empirical evidence regarding the opposite phenomenon of companies disseminating scientific knowledge. our paper aims to fill this gap and explores the motivations of firms that disclose research outcomes in a scientific format. besides considering a dimension internal to the firm, we focus particularly on knowledge sourcing from academic institutions and the appropriability regime. we conduct an econometric analysis with firm-level data from the fourth edition of the french innovation survey (cis) and matched scientific publications for a sample of 2512 r\&d performing firms from all manufacturing sectors. this analysis provides evidence that firms are more likely to adopt academic principles if they need to access scientific knowledge that is considered important for their innovation development, whereas the mere existence of collaborative links with academic institutions is not a strong determinant. furthermore, the results suggest that the inclination of firms to publish is sensitive to the level of knowledge spillovers in a sector and the effectiveness of legal appropriation instruments.

1501,open and scalable analytics of large earth observation datasets: from scenes to multidimensional arrays using scidb and gdal,earth observation; database systems; scalable analytics; open science;; big data; spatial information science,"earth observation (eo) datasets are commonly provided as collection of scenes, where individual scenes represent a temporal snapshot and cover a particular region on the earth's surface. using these data in complex spatiotemporal modeling becomes difficult as soon as data volumes exceed a certain capacity or analyses include many scenes, which may spatially overlap and may have been recorded at different dates. in order to facilitate analytics on large eo datasets, we combine and extend the geospatial data abstraction library (gdal) and the array-based data management and analytics system scidb. we present an approach to automatically convert collections of scenes to multidimensional arrays and use scidb to scale computationally intensive analytics. we evaluate the approach in three study cases on national scale land use change monitoring with landsat imagery, global empirical orthogonal function analysis of daily precipitation, and combining historical climate model projections with satellite-based observations. results indicate that the approach can be used to represent various eo datasets and that analyses in scidb scale well with available computational resources. to simplify analyses of higher dimensional datasets as from climate model output, however, a generalization of the gdal data model might be needed. all parts of this work have been implemented as open-source software and we discuss how this may facilitate open and reproducible eo analyses.
