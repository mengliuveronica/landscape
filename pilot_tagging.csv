1514,the regression trap and other pitfalls of replication scienceillustrated by the report of the open science collaboration,,"the open science collaboration's 2015 report suggests that replication effect sizes in psychology are modest. however, closer inspection reveals serious problems. when plotting replication effects are against original effects, the regression trap is lurking: expecting replication effects to be equally strong as original effects is logically unwarranted; they are inevitably subject to regressive shrinkage. to control for regression, the reliability of original and replication studies must be taken into account. further problems arise from missing manipulation checks and sampling biases. our critical comment highlights the need for replication science to live up to the same methodological scrutiny as other research.",representative design; ability,10.1080/01973533.2017.1421953

1603,the varieties of student experience - an open research question and some ways to answer it,,"based on meetings of the society for research into higher education's student experience network over the past three years, the genuinely open research question is posed whether there is one or more undergraduate student experience within english higher education. answering this question depends on whether what is taught or what is learnt is examined. if the latter, then a unitary student experience can be said to exist only in the narrowest of normative senses. what undergraduates actually learn - defined in the widest sense - is the \$64,000 question of research on the student experience. various ways to answer this question are proposed, including using students to research students. conceptual tools to apply to findings can be developed from youth studies and cognate disciplines, particularly in relation to student identities and aspirations. lastly, these proposals are placed in the wider context of comparative models of the varieties of student experience, including those emerging in the uk's national regions.",,10.1080/03075070802373222

1872,"a re-analysis of the data in sharkey et al.'s (2021) minimalist revision reveals that bins do not deserve names, but bold systems needs a stronger commitment to open science",,"halting biodiversity decline is one of the most critical challenges for humanity, but monitoring biodiversity is hampered by taxonomic impediments. one impediment is the large number of undescribed species (here called ``dark taxon impediment'') whereas another is caused by the large number of superficial species descriptions, that can only be resolved by consulting type specimens (''superficial description impediment''). recently, sharkey et al. (2021) proposed to address the dark taxon impediment for costa rican braconid wasps by describing 403 species based on coi barcode clusters (''bins'') computed by bold systems. more than 99\% of the bins (387 of 390) were converted into species by assigning binominal names (e.g. bin ``bold:acm9419'' becomes bracon federicomatarritai) and adding a minimal diagnosis (consisting only of a consensus barcode for most species). we here show that many of sharkey et al.'s species are unstable when the underlying data are analyzed using different species delimitation algorithms. add the insufficiently informative diagnoses, and many of these species will become the next ``superficial description impediment'' for braconid taxonomy because they will have to be tested and redescribed after obtaining sufficient evidence for confidently delimiting species. we furthermore show that sharkey et al.'s approach of using consensus barcodes as diagnoses is not functional because it cannot be applied consistently. lastly, we reiterate that coi alone is not suitable for delimiting and describing species, and voice concerns over sharkey et al.'s uncritical use of bins because they are calculated by a proprietary algorithm (resl) that uses a mixture of public and private data. we urge authors, reviewers and editors to maintain high standards in taxonomy by only publishing new species that are rigorously delimited with open-access tools and supported by publicly available evidence.",species delimitation method; parasitoid flies diptera; dna barcodes;; conservacion guanacaste; taxonomy; morphology; sepsidae; genus;; identification; tachinidae,10.1111/cla.12489

634,how open science influences next developments in grey literature,,"the practice of open science reinforces the intersections of open access, open data, open educational resources (textbooks), open methods, open standards, open transcription, open peer review, to promote how science is based on replication of experimental process and outcomes. traditional publishing streams of books and journals capture just a fraction of the content now contextualized in open science. our definition of open science blends the foster open science taxonomy with contextualizing science as abraham flexner summarized in the great paradox of scientific research. we suggest how scholarly communication today is inclusive of the range of grey literature that supports the sciences. applying the foster paradigm of understanding open science to the grey literature rubric allows us to explain how scientific publishing has expanded to include new forms of scholarship including theses, patents, standards, models, preprints, systematic reviews, formulas, specimens, instrumentation, spatial information, data sets, lab manuals, interviews, visual miscellany, networks, genomics, proteomics, computational analysis, and other emerging fields. multimedia encompasses some of these examples and new media releases promote changes in product development, thus creating a new sense of authors and communities of users. weaving the taxonomy into the new web of scientific grey literature where there is a greater demand for understanding impact and competitive intelligence by assessing scientific outcomes per scientist, institution, and national scope. we will demonstrate how the process of grant seeking, writing, funding and expectations that are such a large component of scientific research contribute to outputs, innovation and new forms of grey literature. the compliance and regulatory demands at every government level demonstrate how shifts in scholarly communication attempt to create an open and transparent environment where each stage of research is documented and to which all parties are held accountable. open science will continue to generate new knowledge, promote multiple forms of collaboration and release new products in this ecosystem of open science. our findings conclude that innovation to achieve and meet open science goals assume that the scientific record will be open, secure and reflective of how grey literature continues to evolve.",,

1293,macrophage migration and phagocytosis are controlled by kindlin-3's link to the cytoskeleton,,"major myeloid cell functions from adhesion to migration and phagocytosis are mediated by integrin adhesion complexes, also known as adhesome. the presence of a direct integrin binding partner kindlin-3 is crucial for these functions, and its lack causes severe immunodeficiency in humans. however, how kindlin-3 is incorporated into the adhesome and how its function is regulated is poorly understood. in this study, using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we show that kindlin-3 directly interacts with paxillin (pxn) and leupaxin (lpxn) via g43/l47 within its f0 domain. surprisingly, disruption of kindlin-3-pxn/lpxn interactions in raw 264.7 macrophages promoted cell spreading and polarization, resulting in upregulation of both general cell motility and directed cell migration, which is in a drastic contrast to the consequences of kindlin-3 knockout. moreover, disruption of kindlin-3-pxn/lpxn binding promoted the transition from mesenchymal to amoeboid mode of movement as well as augmented phagocytosis. thus, these novel links between kindlin-3 and key adhesome members pxn/lpxn limit myeloid cell motility and phagocytosis, thereby providing an important immune regulatory mechanism.",leukocyte migration; structural basis; open science; integrin; paxillin;; adhesion; activation; generation; actin; c5a,10.4049/jimmunol.1901134
